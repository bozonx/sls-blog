Let's talk about feminine, overly sexy casual outfits. These are leggings, bikinis, very short skirts, deep cleavage, nude tops, etc.

## Is there a problem?

The main problem is that men's sexual attention is irritated in a constant mode. Our sexuality is in a slightly aroused state all the time. Older men may resist this or not notice half-naked women on the street, but younger men are practically doomed to be slaves to their sexual instincts.

## The Consequences of Parasitizing Male Sexuality

- Blurred judgment, confused thoughts and unexpectedly popping up as if from nowhere sexual thoughts. Excitement, even not strong in men leads to a fuzzy mind. And since this arousal is maintained constantly, this effect is not even noticeable, it becomes the norm
- It is difficult to be focused on something important and prioritize. This is also a consequence of constant agitation, although there may be different reasons for this. We can do some unimportant small things, but we can't focus on the important and big ones and keep them in focus all the time
- Sex becomes an obsession. We think about it all the time and spend a lot of time, energy, effort and money to get it. Here you are courses on pickup, and here you are dinamshchitsy and sluts from Tinder - all trying to profit from you at the expense of your overheated sexual desire
- All of this has an overall effect on our lives. Because of a clouded and unfocused mind, we don't act effectively and occupy our thoughts and free time with seeking sex rather than self-development and creating something of value in our lives
- Since men are overly preoccupied with sex, they may even humiliate themselves for the sake of sex, and of course women take advantage of this because they have created this picture of the world. They manipulatively force men to humiliate themselves for sex, to beg for it.
- Because of the fact that there are a lot of women who want to profit from men, some men not satisfying their sexual needs makes them depressed and can lead to asexuality, when a man gives up the intention to have sex at all.
- A fixation on sex causes some men to keep looking for sex even if they have a steady sexual partner. Instead of settling down and focusing his energy and his time on something more important, he remains in an active search for sex. By the way, to the question of women's complaints about men's cheating - in fact, they themselves have created the conditions for it

So you get it - men gain absolutely nothing from it, but only lose.

Monks, for example, seclude themselves in a monastery to keep their minds clear. But you don't have to do that, you can learn to keep your sexuality under control.

## Let's see what women get

- Sluts and dynamos of course get more men's approaches and attention.
- If there's more men to approach, women have more choice. They do not need to strain in the search for men - take and sift out, leave the richer arseholes, take pleasure in humiliating men and destroying their self-esteem.
- Constant sexual excitement of men pushes them to get acquainted more often with the purpose of sex. But women have the goal to divorce men for money. Accordingly, women implicitly thus increase their material well-being.
- Of course women get a lot of pleasure from men's attention and of course they do not care that they get it in an unfair way
- They self-assert themselves and inflate their self-esteem at the expense of men. You may even hear scientists say that this is how women with low self-confidence dress and want to increase it and we should respect that. That's nonsense, of course! We shouldn't respect something that's harmful to us.
- Even married women and women in relationships dress like that. They just want to get high, to bask in men's attention. That makes it very difficult for men to figure out which woman is who - who is a whore, who is a dynamite, who is looking for a man for a relationship, and who is married
- Since you don't know in advance which woman is which. Then everyone gets about the same amount of attention, both whores and married, and all have the opportunity to cash in on it.

You realize that such attention is not honest, that is, they have done nothing important and valuable to society, just bare their bodies and received a lot of attention, compliments and raised their self-esteem to the skies and walk around with their noses up. Because of this, women who prefer a more closed style of dress are left behind and begin to envy and slowly try on slutty outfits, or hate men for the fact that they do not show as much attention to them as to whores.

## What can be done

- We have to recognize that the world is not going to change right now, no matter how much we want it to. So you have to learn not to react to women during the day, when you are walking around the city, at work, in cafes, and so on. It is necessary to control and notice your reactions and interrupt them as soon as you recognize that you have started arousal or flow of sexual thoughts
- Don't be afraid that controlling your arousal will somehow negatively affect your ability to get aroused when you need it. It doesn't. You can keep your arousal under control and be perfectly fine getting aroused when you want to have sex.
- If sexual thoughts are intrusive, consider seeing a therapist.
- Make an impact on the world. Condemn toxic sexuality, ridicule sluts and dyamas. Call things by their proper names - call these outfits slutty outfits. Label the whores who dress excessively revealingly
- Of course women are bound to show all their toxicity and call you misogynistic, nerdy, gay or impotent. Such aggressive behavior should be disgusting and of course show this disgust to her in front of other people - this is what they are most afraid of. Also stand up for other men who make fun of whores if you see a shitstorm in the comments
- Remember that this style is **imposed** on us as normal. In Turkey, for example, many women wear closed clothes and don't expose themselves and it's normal there.
- Of course ridicule women who show that they are sporty and wear a sports top and tight shorts on their naked body. These are monkeys who saw somewhere that professional athletes, cyclists dress like that and they are sportswomen too, although there is no professionalism there. To wear cycling shorts if you don't do cycling is really ridiculous.
- If you hear the slutty manipulation “if you have something to show, why not show it”. The answer is obvious - walk around naked. You don't want to be naked, so you're lying. Other manipulations: if you don't like it, don't look, you just don't like women, you're a sexist. Well, in general, you can hear a lot of things

As for the beach, there's not much you can do. Of course, frank bikinis are not obligatory on the beach, there are also closed swimsuits, and in Turkey some women in general bathe in closed clothing and have no problems with this. But here it will be very difficult to influence, as beach fashion is already ingrained in the public consciousness.

## Toxic sex appeal doesn't end with women's clothes alone

- Advertisements for men's products sometimes use images of nearly naked sexy women to influence men's choices about the advertised product. Such aggressive marketing should be censured and condemned as it is a direct exploitation of our sexual instinct. By the way, there is less such advertising nowadays, but I think it is more due to complaints about the negative impact on children
- The avatars of HR professionals working with I.T. people look like they're for a dating site. This too is a toxic influence on men and exploitation of their sexuality for personal gain. It should only cause disgust

As you've noticed all of this is part of the world of women, a world entirely built on lies and manipulation. By opposing it we make the world a better place, not only for us men, but even for many women who support traditional values. But by not intervening, or worse, by supporting the exploitation of male sexuality, we make the world a worse place.
