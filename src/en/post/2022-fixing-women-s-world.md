In [last article](2022-women-s-world-how-women-influence-men) we looked at how women influence us and how they shape public opinion to make the world comfortable for themselves and not comfortable for men.

## So what to do?

1. Don't give in to pressure from women. Your life belongs to you, not to them. You are free to behave and dress as you please.
2. There's no escaping conflict. But you will see the real essence of women - how crazy and aggressive they are, craving unconditional control over men. In fact, it is a great experience, participating in conflicts you will learn a lot and very quickly you will grow and become free from public opinion
3- Don't give up under the pressure of women. Their task is to break you, just stand and you will stand, they can not do anything to you
3. Tell other men about women's manipulations and the true nature of women.
4. Start influencing the world yourself, but with healthy ideas, unlike women.

## What ideas do we support to influence the world in regards to men and women:

- We dress as we are comfortable and convenient, we don't need to conform to some women's ideas and we don't need to dress to please them, we need to please ourselves. We support other men who feel the same way
- You can eliminate almost all spending on women: don't buy flowers, don't take her to restaurants, and don't order her a cab. You can go on a date to the park, eat ice cream and buy condoms, these expenses are enough.
- You do not need a cool car and you do not need to go to the gym just for women. Consider a more interesting sport for yourself. Criticize the statements of women and arseholes if they say that a man should have a car and be a jock.
- Why do you need brutality and tattoos? If you only need them to get approval from women and to scare other men, it's a bad idea.
- If you see a shitstorm in the comments and that feminists are crushing a masculist or a free man, then support him, take his side. You will help to win this virtual battle (women treat it as a battle), and thus locally prevent the spread of feminist ideas and other people will see that there is an alternative opinion and that not everyone agrees with the ideas imposed by feminists.
- Leave comments on posts that contain manipulation of men and feminist insanity. Do not be afraid of aggression from feminists, use conflicts with feminists to strengthen your spirit. In time, you will no longer be afraid of conflicts, you will learn to solve them in your favor and win
- Ridicule feminists, women with a sense of grandeur and consumerism towards men, as well as help other men to do it on the Internet and in life.
- Sensible men are against abortion by the sole decision of a woman, against deprivation of rights in marriage and divorce, against parasitizing men, against taking children away from fathers after divorce, against alimony as it exists now, against conscription, against ostensible "equality" when men are fired in order to recruit an equal number of women, against recognizing men guilty of violence and abuse by default without trial, against a higher retirement age for men compared to the age of consent, against the fact that men are not allowed to work, against the fact that men are not allowed to work, against the fact that men are not allowed to work, against the fact that men are not allowed to work, against the fact that men are not allowed to work, against the fact that men are not allowed to work, against the fact that men are not allowed to work, against the fact that men are not allowed to work, against the fact that men are not allowed to work. In general, against all this wild stuff that is going on in many countries of the world now and which is promoted by feminists.
- Whenever possible, broadcast the right picture of the world, and criticize the wrong one.
- Don't be afraid of the pain women want to inflict on you, such as making you an outcast, crazy in the eyes of the community or degrading your sexuality - this pain is virtual, but if they can push you or other men around, the consequences will be real - your mental well-being will deteriorate and the world will become a little worse and you will become worse off in it.

## You can't negotiate with feminists ##

Remember that feminists are impossible to negotiate with and find common ground with, not because we don't want to, but because they don't want to. If you think you have found common ground with feminists, don't be fooled, it's probably just another feminist manipulation. Don't become as crazy and aggressive as feminists. Never let feminists into your community - they are sure to destroy it from within. Do not do good to feminists, they will never be grateful to you, for them you will always be the enemy. Don't forget that feminists don't create anything, they only destroy it.

## Our goal

Our goal is to influence the world, but to remain calm and not to be provoked. We know that the world is the way it is now and we can influence it a little bit. We should not hate the world because it is not what we want it to be, but we take every opportunity to do our part to make the world a better place. Just as women have been able to make the world comfortable for themselves, we can make the world comfortable for us, but it takes consistency and support for each other.

By understanding female manipulation, over time you will become immune to manipulation and not just female manipulation.
