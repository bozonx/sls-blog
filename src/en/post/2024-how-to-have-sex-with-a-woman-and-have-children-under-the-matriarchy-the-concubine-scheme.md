date: 2024-10-09T00:00-03:00
description: How to safely interact with a woman in a matriarchy, how to get sex with her and how to have children so that they are not taken away from you? I will answer all these and many other questions today. I will talk about the ”Concubine" scheme, which I developed based on the philosophy of the System of Personal Freedom, taking into account matriarchy, the female psyche, female manipulation, infringement of men's rights in modern society, and most importantly, taking into account men's life goals.

> Disclaimer: so that I'm not accused of discrediting family values or something similar, I declare that the method I propose is oriented only towards free men and all information is oriented towards them, not everyone. I do not call for the rejection of traditional values by large masses of people, but for those who can think and notice that something is wrong here, I show that there is another choice, while not calling for anything. Also, there is no hatred towards women in this issue, and I certainly don't call for that. If something seemed that way to you, it means that you misunderstood me.

## Current Situation with Men's Rights

I'll start by describing the current situation to make it clear why I'm proposing this particular solution that we'll talk about today.

It's now 2024, the era of victorious feminism, we live in a matriarchy, which means that we, men, have practically no rights in many matters compared to women, who are not only endowed with all rights but also have simply insane privileges provided to them by men, while often not having even basic rights themselves. Women have privileges before the law, they receive significantly lighter punishments for the same crimes as men, and in some cases bear no punishment at all, in particular, women have the exclusive right to domestic violence if it concerns minor harm to health, while women commit domestic violence much more often than men, and psychological violence towards husbands and children by women is so widespread and isn't even condemned by society. Women also have huge privileges in virtually any direction you look.

For example, let's highlight 3 privileges that relate to today's topic:

1. Sole right to the child. The child is actually recognized by the state as women's property, while the man is completely powerless regarding his children. In fact, a man has the opportunity to see his children only if the woman allows him to. No courts, no instances will help if a woman decides not to allow the father to see his child. In the West, the situation is slightly better, while in the post-Soviet space it's catastrophic
2. Now it's matriarchy, which means a woman's word is law, it's enough for her to just say or point a finger at a man and he'll be put in prison on false charges of rape, harassment, or pedophilia. You can collect as many papers as you want, prove that you didn't commit anything like that, the court won't believe you because you're a man, and the court believes women at their word, because it's matriarchy, and judges and everyone who works in these instances are feminists. Here, on the contrary, everything is bad in the West, and better in the post-Soviet space, for example, in Russia, the law on harassment hasn't been adopted yet, but nevertheless, false accusations of rape are not rare
3. A woman has the right to half of the property that the husband earned while they were married, and women usually don't invest anything in creating common goods, but on the contrary, only demand and excessively consume, creating additional burden on the man. Moreover, in some countries, even cohabitation can be equated to marriage and a woman can demand half of her cohabitant's property

One could list many insane privileges of women, but these three are enough to put a big cross on classic relationships and especially marriage. And notice this is not because I declare it, but because the government in many countries has made it so.

## What I Propose

I suggest first figuring out what we actually need from women and based on this already building plans, acting, and taking reasonable risks if the goals justify it. So, if you think about it, we, men, need only 2 things from women - first is sex and second is having children, we don't need anything else from them, moreover, for sex there are substitutes like sex dolls and other sexual entertainment, so essentially the only thing truly needed is having children.

Women know perfectly well what we need from them, so they created vagina capitalism, the essence of which is trading their vagina and this is done, with rare exceptions, by every woman and this isn't even considered prostitution under vagina capitalism, although it actually is. I talked about vagina capitalism in more detail in a separate issue. I emphasize once again that it's not just some prostitutes who sell themselves, but almost every woman.

It would seem well, okay, we pay money and get access to the vagina - everything is simple. But the problem is that women have deprived men of the ability to influence the price, therefore having a complete monopoly on sex, vagina capitalists set simply insane prices for their vagina. Every plain Jane requires that a man become her slave, give her everything he has, regularly buy her expensive gifts and pay her from a thousand dollars a month, while he still must be tall and muscular, have a beautiful body, take care of her, grovel before her and deserve that she wants to date him and at the same time she reserves the right to date other suckers in parallel and doesn't take on any responsibilities for taking care of the man and his home, moreover such women openly declare that they principally won't help a man when he gets sick and won't bring him the proverbial glass of water. With all this, sex isn't guaranteed for the man. Despite all expenses on the woman, he'll get it only if she wants to give it, and if he wants to get what he paid for and she's against it, he'll be put in prison. An important point is that if a man has children with a vagina capitalist, he'll never be sure if these are his children, because she'll forbid him to do a DNA test under the threat of breaking up and that she'll take the children away from him.

The situation has become simply hopeless and a huge number of men who don't want to go for such insane conditions or simply don't have so much money have become incels not by their own will, that is, vagina capitalists have forced them into sexual abstinence, and how this affects the birth rate, I think even an idiot understands. And those men who go for such extremely unfavorable conditions lose very very much and get nothing except a ton of illusions and non-guaranteed sex.

I thought for a long time about how to get out of this situation and eventually found a solution. Moreover, a solution that will not only get what a man needs right now, but also when the idea spreads will greatly improve the situation for many free men. The basis of my solution is this reasoning: since now there's vagina capitalism and there's no possibility to find a woman who wouldn't trade herself, then we should knock down the price and set our conditions for the money we pay.

## Alternative Options

Before moving on to telling about my scheme, let's first consider what options men generally have for getting sex with a woman and having children.

To get sex:

1. You can start classic relationships with a woman. Obviously this is the worst option because it means slavery and big losses for men
2. You can have short relationships with single mothers during her period of hormonal intoxication during which she'll be kind and affectionate and break up with her when this period ends, which some men's movement bloggers advise. Not such a good idea in my opinion, it requires too much concentration of attention, you need to constantly be in search and also try not to let the woman outplay you. And an important point that this scheme has already almost lost relevance due to the wide spread of feminism, and therefore misandry, that is, man-hatred because of which women have largely lost the ability to fall in love with men as before, they consider men exclusively from utilitarian considerations
3. Pickup - I think it can no longer be considered again due to feminism and the widespread hatred of men among women. You can run into a misandrist and she'll call the police, accusing you of harassment to express her hatred of all men in your person or just to be mean. Therefore, pickup has become simply unsafe. Obviously this is not in all countries, but the trend is depressing
4. Going to prostitutes. This topic is forced in the Solo Life movement. There are different opinions on this. My personal opinion is that the risk of contracting venereal diseases isn't worth it. But at the same time I consider lingam massage a good alternative
5. Various sexual entertainment like sex dolls and homosexual sex, well this is for amateurs. Although sex dolls seem like a good alternative and according to the stories of their users, they like sex with them even more than with real women
6. Sex tourism to countries of male sex tourism. An excellent option, I think, if you start relationships in these countries, and not just go to prostitutes. But this option doesn't suit everyone
7. Find a MILF for sex. Some older women are looking for men only for sex, they don't want to live together and build relationships, they have children, wealth, an apartment, everything is there, they only lack regular sex. Therefore, if you find such a MILF, you can negotiate sex with her for free. This is an excellent option in my opinion
8. And finally, not looking for sex at all. A wonderful option, solves a lot of problems, leaving only one single problem - lack of sex, if you can somehow cope with this then it's excellent overall

And now let's consider options for having children

1. Classic relationships and marriage - a terrible option, for men it often turns into complete collapse
2. Surrogacy. That is, hire a woman to give birth to a child for you and give it to you, while the egg doesn't necessarily have to belong to the surrogate mother, it can be taken from an egg bank. It would seem an ideal option, but it has a number of limitations and complications and the biggest problem in my opinion is that the child won't have a mother, we men are not as immoral as women to take away one of the parents from a child
3. Have a child in a sex tourism country and sometimes come to him and regularly send money to the mother. This option is used by middle-aged and older men from the USA and other developed countries, overall the option is not bad if you don't allow the woman to get impudent
4. Date a woman a little, have a child and disappear. Such a thought can be heard in some men's movement circles from people who consider themselves alpha males. But there's no point in this, it doesn't give anything fundamentally, because to get realization through children you need happy fatherhood, not just the actual having of children. There's no big benefit, and the risks under matriarchy increase very much
5. Go to another country yourself, don't get citizenship there and have a child there. That is, the idea is that it's just pointless for her to take the child away from you, since she won't be able to file for alimony, and if she files, you'll just leave the country. There's a reasonable grain in this idea, but it may turn out that you'll never return to this country again and there's a high risk that she'll blackmail you

As you can see, there are options for getting sex with a woman and having children, you can choose different ways. If you don't plan to have children then the choice of getting sex is relatively wide even under matriarchy, although not easily accessible, you'll have to get complicated. But if you want to have a child then there are already problems, there aren't really good options.

That's why I developed the concubine scheme to solve all problems at once, namely:

- Get regular sex with a low danger of contracting venereal diseases
- Spend a minimum of energy and attention on relationships to spend them on something more important: on your projects, mission, business and favorite work
- Spend only a reasonable and controlled amount of money on a woman and protect yourself from the financial collapse that a woman can lead to
- Have children, get happy fatherhood and have full rights to children
- With all this, not lose happiness, freedom and peace, achieve your life goals, realization and spiritual development

Unfortunately, I haven't found other ways to solve all these tasks simultaneously at once.

## The "Concubine" Scheme

So, dear friends, I present to your attention the "Concubine" scheme:

The essence is that a man monthly pays not a very large amount of money to a woman as a salary. This amount is from 100 to 200 US dollars, depending on the country, city and the result of bargaining with the woman. In some cases, it can be both lower and higher, but not more than $500 if we're not talking about countries with high salaries. I personally don't think it's reasonable to pay more than $500 per month for a woman, I'm not even sure there are such women for whom you can pay such money.

That is, it's something like a subscription to a woman or hiring an employee for work. For this money, we get what we need and at the same time don't get what we don't need. Moreover, we have the right to make our demands for this money, just as an employer makes demands on an employee.

What we demand:

1. That she doesn't have sex with other men while she's dating you. And if you leave for a long time, require that she use protection and undergo a medical examination upon your return. (Why so I'll tell about this yet)
2. We can demand that she either live with us or come to us 2-3 times a week for sex
3. That she clean, cook and serve you and your home
4. If you decide to have a child, that she work as the mother of your child

These are all the requirements and obviously they're very simple, that's why I said there's no point in paying big money, especially considering that it's impossible to forbid a woman not to go around, so paying for the illusion that she's supposedly faithful to you is just pointless. Of course, if there were women who could guarantee faithfulness, then you could pay more, but unfortunately this doesn't exist and is unlikely to appear.

Well, and in case you don't want to have children and use cleaning services, then there remain only 2 requirements - that she doesn't cheat and regularly comes for sex. Well, just minimal requirements, accordingly in such a case you can pay even less than $100.

Besides what we get from the Concubine scheme, it's also important to guard against what we don't need

1. Most importantly for us, free people, we won't fall into women's slavery, we won't allow her to enslave us, because we ourselves set the rules of the game and have control over the situation
2. Won't allow a woman to destroy our life. She won't be able to make you suffer and won't be able to mock you, using children and a wide range of manipulations and sadistic techniques that women use in marriage to get pleasure from the husband's suffering
3. The probability that your child will be taken away is significantly reduced, and if they do take it away, you'll suffer much less accompanying losses than in marriage
4. You don't bear unnecessary responsibility for the woman, she doesn't impose a bunch of tasks on you, as usually happens in marriage, she doesn't impose her mother-in-law and other relatives on you and doesn't harness you to do some tasks for them
5. And importantly, we'll guard against psychological violence that women commit in all classic families regularly, literally every day. And also naturally we'll guard against physical violence from women, although there's no 100% guarantee of course, because women are becoming more and more aggressive

## Limitations and Possible Problems

Unfortunately, this scheme isn't perfect, but not in itself but because of matriarchy.

1. There's no 100% guarantee that the child won't be taken away from you. Under matriarchy, you simply can't get such a guarantee, but still if everything is done legally correctly, the probability of children being taken away is not high
2. If now in some country there are more or less adequate laws giving at least some minimal guarantees and rights to men, it won't always be so, because the situation in the world isn't improving at all, but on the contrary is getting worse and with acceleration. Women's privileges are steadily growing, and men's rights are decreasing. Therefore, having a child and successfully registering everything legally now, there are no guarantees that in the future laws won't change for the worse. Well, and such rapid development of feminism as now paints a very joyless picture of the future
3. You'll be under constant pressure from the concubine herself and other women to abandon this venture and marry your concubine. Of course, she'll make an unhappy face and other women will say that you're torturing her, she loves you, and you're so cold-blooded. You'll have to learn to resist this. But in countries of male sex tourism, these problems will obviously be less

## Legal Question

I'll say right away that I'm not a lawyer, but nevertheless, I searched for information and found several interesting ways for a man to obtain rights to a child in a matriarchy, which can be considered. If you have more knowledge, please share it in the comments or in our chat, link in the description.

Our goal is to get full custody and full rights to the child, which under matriarchy can only be achieved if the child's mother gives up her rights, completely. Half and half in fact under matriarchy means that the man has no rights to the child, because courts, guardianship authorities, juvenile inspection, and similar instances will always make decisions in favor of the woman, because feminists work there.

And another goal of ours is to ensure that the child still communicates with their biological mother, we're not as cruel as women and not as immoral as they are to take away one of the child's parents. That is, we seek the woman's renunciation of her parental rights only legally, but in fact, she will work for you as the mother of your child with her, meaning factually nothing will fundamentally change for her and the child, it will look as if you're a family, only she won't have the ability to separate you from the child. Actually, all this fuss is precisely for this.

So, the most reliable option and at the same time the only one that gives 100% legal guarantee that the woman won't take the child away from you is a surrogacy agreement. You can conclude this agreement with your concubine and live together as if a family. But there are limitations: by age up to 35 years, by the woman's health condition, the woman must already have at least 1 child of her own, there must be medical indications for surrogacy, and surrogacy services may be prohibited for foreigners. In addition, the use of surrogacy for a single man is significantly complicated legally or explicitly prohibited, depending on the country, in Russia for example it's prohibited.

Honestly, everything there is made so that surrogacy is used only for medical reasons in case a couple can't have children naturally, and just having a child and using this agreement as protection of men's rights is extremely difficult, but again it heavily depends on the country.

If surrogacy is not suitable, there are other options, but none of them gives 100% guarantee that the child's mother won't take him away from you, but nevertheless they give very high chances of success.

From such options, in my opinion, the best would be the mother's renunciation of the child in favor of the father immediately after birth in exchange for a one-time payment of a large sum of money comparable to the cost of surrogacy. But the problem is that there is no such law, at least in Russia and CIS countries, but I think in other countries too. But nevertheless, the mother's renunciation of parental rights can still be done through court, there are several reasons that can be indicated in the lawsuit, such as the mother's alcoholism and the like, but among them we are interested in 2 reasons - 1st is that the woman is poor and cannot support the child, although of course this will still need to be proven, and 2nd is her conscious refusal in favor of a guardian - this is exactly what we need. However, it's not clear whether you need to indicate in the maternity hospital that you're the father or on the contrary not need to indicate and then appear in court as if you're a stranger. And an important point is that if you're a foreigner, I don't think the court will prefer to leave the child to a foreigner rather than a local resident. Although if you look for good lawyers then everything is possible, the problem is where to find them.

There are other options too, but without corruption they may be difficult to implement:

1. The woman can refuse the child right in the maternity hospital, that is, not transfer to the father, but namely refuse, leaving him in the maternity hospital. But in this case it's not clear how the child's father can immediately take him, maybe there's some long procedure, it may take a lot of time and there may be a competition, during which the child may be taken by other parents
2. Give birth to a child and process documents through an orphanage. That is, like she gave the child to an orphanage, thereby refusing her rights, and you immediately took him. Again, without corruption, this is likely a lengthy procedure and there is also a chance that the child may be taken by other people, and adoption may be prohibited for single men. And something tells me that to prevent child trafficking, such document flow is given special attention by the state

Dealing with corruption is bad and it increases your risks in general, also gives the woman an opportunity to blackmail you by saying that she will report corruption to the police.

When assessing risks, it's important to consider that a woman, even after giving up her parental rights, can still go to court to restore them, after all it's matriarchy. I assume that a woman may even try to challenge the surrogacy agreement. But I think the probability of this is not high and to prevent her from having such desires, just after you part with her, don't forbid her to see the child, let them communicate, and if you change your place of residence, then sometimes bring the child to the mother.

In general, there are options, yes they're not simple, you'll have to spend on lawyers, get complicated, but the most important thing is that the possibility to get full rights to the child still exists even under matriarchy, despite all the difficulties and risks.

> And for those who still don't believe that it's matriarchy now, just evaluate how easily a woman can give a child to an orphanage, just with one hand movement, and how difficult it is to transfer a child to the father so that the father becomes his sole guardian and has rights to the child. This is called matrilineality, it means that children and property are transferred through the female line, this is the main marker of matriarchy. It's not hard to notice that this is to some extent in almost all countries of the world, with few exceptions. I hope now your doubts that it's matriarchy now have completely dissolved.

In conclusion of the legal topic, I want to consider 3 more options that I've heard in the masculine environment, but they don't suit us:

1. A foreigner will come to your country and you will have a child with her. The reasoning here is: since she's powerless in your country, she won't be able to take the child away from you. The problem is that when a child is born, in many countries of the world he is given citizenship of the country in which he was born, moreover citizenship is given to parents, meaning she will get citizenship and will have the same opportunities to take children away as other citizens of your country
2. Go to another country yourself, don't get citizenship there and have a child there. That is, the idea is that it's just pointless for her to take the child away from you, as she won't be able to file for alimony, and if she files, you'll just leave the country. There is a reasonable grain in this idea, but it may turn out that you'll never return to this country again and there is a high risk that she will blackmail you
3. Prenuptial agreement. It's being discussed in the MD environment, thinking that it will protect a man from everything. But prenuptial agreements, as far as I know, in all countries where they exist, regulate only property matters, not issues concerning children, these issues are resolved exactly the same as in the dissolution of a regular marriage

## Our Goals

You'll ask why I suggest exactly the Concubine scheme, and not any other.

And I'll answer. Firstly, I haven't found other successful schemes, and secondly, to evaluate what's better and what's worse, you need to evaluate relative to something. And I did this relative to our true life goals, what these goals are I discussed in the episode true life goals, there are 5 of these goals - tranquility, freedom, spirituality, happiness, and realization, the latter can largely be called the main life goal and having children, more precisely happy fatherhood, relates precisely to realization. At the same time, having children is only part of our realization, men get a maximum of 40% realization from this and only with happy fatherhood. Women are luckier, they get up to 60% realization, respectively, only with happy motherhood.

The meaning of applying the Concubine scheme is to have a child and maybe even not one, plus also have regular sex with a woman and with all this not just not allow her to destroy your life and lead to a heart attack to die in middle age, but also have chances for longevity and most importantly to achieve your true life goals.

And another point, to make it clear why we strive for long-term relationships with a woman, and not for one-time visits to prostitutes, as some MD bloggers suggest. The point is that in long-term relationships with one woman, there is significantly less chance of catching venereal diseases, but never equal to zero, because it's impossible to force a woman not to cheat. And the second is that we want our children to have a mother, and for this obviously you need to have a long-term relationship with the mother of your children. Perhaps relationships with a concubine can last many many years and then the child will grow up in a complete family, but even if it doesn't work out, the child will still communicate with both parents, I think you won't deprive him of communication with his mother.

It should also be noted that such a scheme is more successful for the child himself and he will be happier. If a man takes full control over the child then he cares about his well-being, and if a woman takes full control over the child, then she cares only about her own well-being and uses the child as a tool for personal enrichment and enslavement of the child's father.

## This is not fair!

I foresee your reaction, men, you'll exclaim this is unfair! After all, we, men, get only 40% realization through children, and a woman 60%, but we also pay her money for this. Yes, this is very very unfair.

But unfortunately, we are in this world, in the world of victorious feminism, under matriarchy and vagina capitalism and we face exactly this choice - either we pay to get our 40% realization through happy fatherhood, or we get nothing. Women have put us in this position and we can't do anything about it yet, so we have to play by these rules to have the opportunity to achieve our life goals.

It's also unfair that women so strongly devalue men's contribution: a man provides, protects women and children and keeps the house, equipment and everything in the house in order, and a woman just waves a mop once a week and performs other very light work that doesn't require special knowledge and skills and is often performed poorly and irregularly and for this a man still has to pay her. This is very unfair, very unfair. But unfortunately this is how things are now. And again, this is not our choice, women have put us before such a choice - either you give a woman provision, safety, easy and relaxed life and also pay her money or you won't get sex with a woman and realization through children - actually this is the essence of vagina capitalism.

Therefore, always remember this, especially when she will manipulate and pretend that she supposedly fell in love with you, she's with you not because of money, when she will say yes why do you need all this, why do you need these complications, let's just get married. Or other women will say "what, can't you find a normal woman and create normal relationships?" - always remember that this is not your choice, these women themselves have put us before this choice - want to reproduce - pay, want your lineage not to die out - pay, want your nation not to die out - pay. Always remember this, never forget, this will always sober up your brain. And remember that you apply this scheme just to survive, because in marriage the chances of surviving middle age for a man are very low.

## What's wrong with marriage

And now we can already compare the "Concubine" scheme with classical relationships, in particular with marriage.

What does marriage or just classical relationships give a man? Regular sex, and actual having children without happy fatherhood and that's all nothing more. That is, a man doesn't get something special in marriage, because sex can be obtained in other ways, and actually having children without happy fatherhood gives nothing and doesn't even need marriage for that matter.

The advantages are questionable and there are very few of them. Now let's examine what's wrong with marriage for a man. If briefly, then everything, but let's look in more detail.

Legally, men in marriage are not just powerless, but also officially are slaves of women. After divorce, a woman will take away children from a man, half of the property and will rob him through alimony, particularly cunning women manage to fraudulently rewrite all the husband's property to themselves and simply throw him out on the street, he drinks himself to death because of this injustice and this is how most homeless men appear.

In principle, just this alone is enough to forget forever the words marriage and registry office. But there are other points:

- The most important thing is the question of survival. Getting married for a man = dying in middle age from cardiovascular diseases and alcoholism, this phenomenon in statistics is called male excess mortality. Accordingly, being single = surviving. That is, this is a matter of life and death. Just don't think that men die by themselves, of course women drive them to this, as they create a lot of stress for men, daily training men for complete submission to themselves
- A woman enslaves a man, makes him her slave, and therefore she changes his life line so that he doesn't achieve his life goals, but achieves her greedy goals
- Accordingly, a man's life goals will not be achieved, and we only have one life. That is, a woman steals life from a man and steals from him the opportunity to achieve life goals
- Moreover, a man won't even get those 40% realization from having children, simply because he won't get happy fatherhood. Fathers in marriage are usually exhausted, their wives constantly drive them - do this, do that, just sits down - she yells at him and throws a bunch of tasks, because she considers him her slave, and a slave should work for the mistress, not rest. There can be no question of happy fatherhood with such an attitude. Worse, if a woman has a child from a lover and lies to her husband that it's his child, this happens not rarely, in this case the man's realization through children will be equal to zero at all. The same applies when a single mother imposes her children on a man and convinces him that there's no need to have common children, because there are already children, you can devote your paternal care to them
- Men generally have no ability to influence relationships and transfer them to some reasonable course. Relationships will be what the woman wants and you can't do anything about it, and they want you to be their slave, and they build exactly such relationships, and to transfer relationships at least to partnership, where spouses respect each other won't work, you just don't have such an opportunity
- In marriage there is no loyalty from the wife. Now women have convinced each other that female infidelity is not just good, but desirable, it allegedly increases female energy, female infidelities and slutty appearance are approved by society. I recently realized that I personally don't know a single family, about which I have, so to speak, insider information, where the woman wouldn't cheat and there wouldn't be suspicions about her, don't know a single such family. But families where the husband is faithful - these are almost all my familiar families, with rare exceptions

That is, marriage has become not just absolutely meaningless for men, but also very destructive. A man can't even get loyalty from his wife, but at the same time a woman demands that a man take full responsibility for her provision, maintenance and safety.

## Glass of Water

You might ask, what about a glass of water? Will your concubine really bring you a glass of water in your old age?

Well, first we need to start with the question - will a wife bring you a glass of water? Where's your certainty that this will happen, that she won't refuse or leave you altogether? Secondly, women aren't focused on living their whole life with a man, let alone serving him in old age; they regularly change men. A typical woman, after living with a man for 3-5 years, deprives him of everything and then jumps to another man like a parasite. I talked about this in more detail in the episode about marriage fraud.

In longer marriages, the woman drives her husband to a heart attack or alcoholism, and he simply doesn't live to see old age. Therefore, there won't be any glass of water from your wife, and you might not even reach old age with such a stressful life, so there's no point in worrying about it.

And in general, women make very selfish plans for the future. A woman wants you to be her slave and serve her in old age, not the other way around. Believe me, women simply don't have the goal of caring for a poor sick old man in their old age, whom they themselves made poor and sick.

And after divorce, women turn children against their father so that he can't count on them in old age, so that the children only serve her when she gets old, not their former husband.

But regarding old age, take care of this issue - we are free and developed people, study investments, create personal capital, find a reliable non-state pension fund with a long successful history in a well-regulated jurisdiction, for example in Austria. In old age, you can simply buy yourself a place in a private nursing home, or move to a country with inexpensive medical services where a patronage nurse will regularly come to your home to take care of you.

Take off your rose-colored glasses and forget about the idea that a woman will want to bring you a glass of water for free, without causing a scandal, when you need it. Altruism and mutual assistance are not about women. Take care of your future yourself.

## Setting the Price

How to assess how much a woman costs? You need to start with a reasonable price range, which is from 100 to 200 US dollars converted to your country's currency. In some cases, you can pay both more and less. You can pay less if you live in an inexpensive country and your requirements for a woman are not high.

And I don't see any point in paying much more. Yes, maybe for a larger amount you can get a more beautiful and young woman, but is it worth paying for? I don't think so. Moreover, young and beautiful women excessively overestimate their price, and they're not even satisfied with $500 per month, but minimum $1000 plus gifts, your attention, and a bunch of crazy demands. That is, from $200 to $1000, there aren't really any reasonable offers, and if we're not talking about countries with high salaries, paying $1000 or more for the simplest services is simply not feasible.

It's clear that women value themselves excessively high, but this is just a price inflated out of thin air. We shouldn't pay their imaginary price; we will only pay for what we get, and we don't get that much, so it doesn't make sense to pay a lot.

What to consider when looking for a woman and evaluating her

1. Country, city, minimum income in this city, and how much cleaning services, nanny, and ready-made food cost, because based on this data, you can roughly estimate how much you can pay. Just don't think about equating the cost of professional services with what a woman does at home haphazardly. You just need to roughly understand what level of payment a woman will agree to, where to start bargaining. Also, don't let her mislead you that she allegedly needs to be paid separately for cleaning and cooking as if two separate high-class specialists are working full time
2. Will she live with you all the time or will she come 2-3 times a week. If she lives with you, she has less freedom, but she doesn't spend money on food and other household expenses, and if she comes 2-3 times a week, she has more freedom, but also more expenses. Logically, one would assume that living with you she should receive less, but the level of freedom also needs to be evaluated and women don't forget to evaluate it. Therefore, these options are either equal in price or it may turn out to be a cheaper option when she comes to you several times a week, although if you pay for her taxi instead of the bus, there won't be much benefit
3. Is having children planned, if planned then in the first 3 years of caring for a child when it really takes a lot of time, you can increase the payment until the child goes to kindergarten. But if she receives benefits from the state, then you may not need to pay much extra
4. Evaluate the woman's age, nationality, whether she has children, and her beauty. In terms of beauty, don't let her deceive you with cosmetics and enhanced appearance. Also, keep in mind that beauty only has value for those women who don't have children, and for single mothers, beauty no longer has great value, so there's no point in paying much extra for it

## What to Pay Attention to When Choosing a Woman and Setting the Price

- First, it wouldn't be bad to pay for her medical examination to identify any venereal diseases, and only after that make plans for this woman
- If you have money, don't think about finding a white, young, and beautiful woman for high payment. Firstly, such women value themselves incredibly high and even payment of $1000 per month they will consider humiliating for themselves and will very actively manipulate you to take away everything you have, and you'll have to work hard to resist these unceasing attacks. Paying big money and getting a bunch of problems is just not reasonable
- But it is reasonable to find a woman with whom there will be the least problems, who will be satisfied with your price and relations with her will be stable for a long time, which will allow you to have children and possibly even children will grow up in a complete family. And the minimum hassle, your attention and time that needs to be spent on relationships will allow you to direct your energy in the direction you need, to your projects, business, or favorite work
- However, I don't recommend excessively lowering the price, trying to bargain for the minimum monthly payment. Because a woman may agree to such unfavorable conditions, in her opinion, for the purpose of fraud. A common example of fraud is when a woman in a relationship fraudulently inclines a man to rewrite his property to her. But there are also outright thefts, for example, there are cases in Thailand when a Thai woman at some point in the relationship robs a man and then disappears with their joint child
- An important point is whether the woman has a child from a previous marriage. If the child is small, then she has a powerful trump card for blackmailing you, she can accuse you of pedophilia, which is not so rare. Ideally, it's better to choose a woman with a child over 16 years old. Options of more than one child under 16 years can be completely ignored, it's very inconvenient and dangerous
- Don't chase after the woman's beauty and youth, thinking that the child will be healthier if born from a beautiful woman. Excessive beauty doesn't strongly affect the quality of genes, average level of beauty is enough and it's important that there are no genetic deviations. Life hack - if you choose a middle-aged woman who was beautiful in her youth, you'll get better genes for your child at a lower price. Naturally, don't let yourself be deceived by cosmetics
- Don't focus only on white women. Filipinas are considered the best wives in the world, and many consider the best sex to be with black panthers. Moreover, such women are often raised patriarchally, very unpretentious and not as greedy as white women. You'll get a younger woman, better sex, better services for home maintenance and yourself, and minimum problems for a lower price. The obvious disadvantage - the child won't be white, but considering all other advantages, many men can turn a blind eye to this

In general, the best price-quality ratio is white MILFs 40+, or younger Filipinas or black panthers (obviously not from developed countries). If you only need sex, then students can be great, but they will most likely demand the maximum - all $200.

## Diversification

We need to talk about one subtle issue, which may seem very cynical to someone, but what I'm going to say now, don't take out of context, this is a way to solve problems specifically in the current situation, which women have created for us, not us.

We're trying to have children in a situation where we don't have 100% guarantee that our children won't be taken away from us. And if there's no 100% guarantee, then how to act? What to count on?

The only right solution in such cases is diversification, that is, just as investors act in the stock market or cryptocurrency market, where there are also never 100% guarantees. And the possibility of not losing and even earning in such conditions is given precisely by diversification. And we should also apply it when having children, because, again, there are no 100% guarantees that they won't be taken away from us.

That is, if you plan more than one child, then having the next child with the same woman increases the risks, she can take all children away from you at once or start blackmailing you cruelly, which will make your life hell. Yes, indeed, having several children with one woman seems more economical, but high risks can lead to complete collapse.

To reduce risks, you need to have no more than two children with one woman, and if you don't plan many children, then have a maximum of one child from one woman and have the next child with another woman. Accordingly, with the previous woman, transfer the relationship to something similar to what sometimes happens after divorce in Western countries when the child lives sometimes with one parent, sometimes with the other.

That is, you break off sexual relations with the previous woman, she will just work as the mother of your child and that's all. But most likely you won't have to specifically break off relations, most likely she will lead them to a break herself, as it usually happens. Accordingly, you'll find a new woman as the main concubine and have another child with her. And to the mother of the previous child, you'll just pay for mother services, accordingly a smaller amount than to the concubine.

Obviously, this scheme increases expenses because you have to pay a little to the mothers of your children + the full amount to the new concubine, not to mention the expenses for each child. Therefore, you need to be financially ready for this. But most importantly, such a scheme significantly reduces risks. Less likely that all your children will be taken away from you at once, and losing only some children will be much easier to survive.

## What to Do If Your Child Is Taken Away from You Anyway

If your child is taken away from you anyway, it means that the risk has worked. If you did everything right and assessed the risks, then you don't need to be upset, because this is not a failure, but it just means that in this sequence of options, the unsuccessful option just worked right away, and the next attempts will be successful, I described in more detail how this works in the episode about luck, link in the description. I emphasize that such an approach only works with reasonable planning and adequate risk assessment, not mindlessly poking your finger in the sky.

What needs to be done? First, you need to acknowledge the losses, traders and investors call this fixing the loss and this needs to be done immediately, don't delay. Fix the loss as soon as you realize that you've suffered losses, because delay will only increase losses. You need to cope with your emotions, emotions in this matter are our enemy. Of course, no one likes to lose, but it's better to lose a little than everything.

You need to go to a psychologist to psychologically detach from the child, survive this and when you're ready, try again with another woman and taking into account all the mistakes you made earlier. And about that child, accordingly, you need to forget forever, because under matriarchy, he is factually and legally not yours, despite the fact that he is yours genetically.

The wrong decision is to run through courts, seeking meetings with your child - under matriarchy, this is just nerve-wracking. Maybe you'll achieve being able to meet with the child, but his mother will turn each meeting into torture for you and often to make it even more difficult for a man to meet with his child, women slander him to the police that he allegedly beat the child and the unfortunate father has to meet with his child only in the presence of a child psychologist, whose time needs to be paid for. You don't need this shit.

Again, if a woman has taken your child away from you, then he is not yours and you can't change this anymore, especially you can never get full rights to the child under matriarchy and the only right option, despite your love and attachment to the child, is to detach from him forever and then try again with another woman. To my great regret, there are simply no other options under matriarchy.

> Here it should be clarified that if you want to influence the situation in general, then by achieving successful court decisions you create corresponding judicial practice, which very beneficially affects the possibility of changing the situation. But in this case, your goal should not be to return the child, but to create the precedent itself, that is, like engaging in social activities, you can also participate in various social movements and initiatives.

But what you really need to do is maximize the reduction in alimony payments or, if you find a way, remove such an obligation altogether. You shouldn't pay alimony for a factually foreign child, with whom you're not allowed to see or each meeting is turned into torture. Under matriarchy, a child can communicate with any men as much as they want, but not with their father. And if so, then you shouldn't pay alimony, let those who can communicate with him pay.

## What to negotiate with a concubine and how to fill out a questionnaire on a dating site

As for where to get acquainted, everything is simple here - just a dating app. An important point, if you live in Western countries, when you invite a woman to a meeting, make sure that she writes an answer so that it is unambiguously read as her consent to your meeting, because you can get on a feminist and she goes to the police, accusing you of harassment in order to shit on all men in your face, in in this case, you can show the correspondence to the policeman. At the same time, it is important to correspond on a dating site, because there is usually no message deletion function.

What should I write in my profile? I recommend that you write down the conditions briefly right away. For example, I propose such a text.

> I am looking for a woman for a friendly sexual relationship, I will pay $ 100 per month, a bargain is possible. I need to clean the house once a week, cook food, do other household chores and give me a massage a couple of times a week.
>
> We will live with me | You will come to me 2-3 times a week, I will pay for public transport.
>
> In the future, I would like to have children, then I will increase the payment for child care for 3 years and make a one-time payment of a large amount after you give up your legal rights to the child, but at the same time you will not lose the opportunity to communicate with him and this will not affect our relationship in any way.

You can start from this text, add something, remove something, do not talk about the child if you do not need it, choose one of the options either living together, or she will come to you 2-3 times a week.

You can enter into a written contract with a concubine, which will specify more detailed conditions, such as:

- You demand from her that she does not cheat on you while you are together, otherwise you will break the contract
- You can also prescribe the situation if you leave for a long time. In this case, you can, as it were, reserve it, pay a small amount to resume the relationship upon return. At the same time, you will not be able to demand loyalty from her, but at least demand that she be protected and undergo a medical commission upon your return. Just don't think that if you pay her more money when you leave, she will be faithful to you, this is a big mistake, she will just deceive you
- Specify the details concerning the child - the amount of a lump sum payment for her renunciation of parental rights and the amount and duration of increased remuneration for child care. Make sure that there is nothing in the paragraph about the payment for her renunciation of parental rights that can be considered ambiguous and interpreted in favor of a woman. It should be clearly stated that she does not claim anything and you do not owe her anything after she renounces parental rights and receives your payment to her. But I hope you will not prevent the child from communicating with his mother
- Immediately prescribe such a moment - you can either start another relationship while you're dating her, or you can't. This is an important moment for her and it can affect the price. If she agrees to this, she may request a large payment, as the risks increase for her. Look for yourself here, I personally don't see the point in this. The establishment of more than one relationship at the same time creates a lot of problems, requires a lot of your time and attention, there will be constant conflicts, inconsistencies and manipulations, and there is no profit at the same time, except to amuse your self-esteem
- To prescribe verbatim what services and with what frequency she should provide you, this is necessary both for her to understand her workload and estimate her salary, and for you not to give her the opportunity in the future to interpret the conditions as she wants
- If additional services are expected, such as running errands, such as going to the store, taking the car to the car wash, picking up the order from the pick-up point, and the like, then you need to specify how many orders per week or per month you can demand from her and how much you will pay extra if you exceed this limit. Again, the more precise the conditions, the less opportunities she has for manipulation
- Indicate that manipulations and provocations on her part are a good reason for termination of the contract. You don't pay her to manipulate you.
- It can be clearly indicated that the concubine declares that during the period of validity of this agreement, attempts to accuse you of rape and harassment are deliberately false. It's clear that the feminist judge will just wipe herself with this piece of paper, but just in case it suddenly helps. For example, BDSM lovers sign such statements and, thanks to them, have legal protection in some countries

## The result

- It may seem that there are too many difficulties. Not really. I just paid a lot of attention to various subtleties and possible problems, but if you look into it, there are much fewer difficulties than with other approaches, especially with marriage. If you look at the whole, then the essence of the scheme is extremely simple
- The essence of the concubine scheme is that we stimulate a woman with money to fulfill certain obligations and at the same time we put a woman in a strict framework, the violation of which promises to break your relationship. That is, as when applying for a job - if an employee does not fulfill his obligations, then you dismiss him
- It is important that we get from the relationship only what we need, and it is equally important that we do not get what we do not need. This is the most important difference between the Concubine scheme and other types of relationships
- In comparison with marriage, the probability of complete collapse is very low. It is also obvious that in the future, the Concubine scheme will be much cheaper and costs will be controlled, because in marriage, women fraudulently, under various pretexts, manage to extort from their husband almost all the money that he earns
- The concubine scheme is great for just having sex with a woman, but at the same time it is also great for having children, and not just an actual institution, but getting a happy fatherhood for yourself and a full-fledged family for the child
- Outwardly, it seems that the “Concubine” scheme is similar to marriage - it seems the same, a man and a woman live together, have children and raise them together. But this is only externally, inside the difference is enormous. The main difference from marriage is that in marriage a man does not control the situation at all and he does not have any trump cards, a woman has all the trump cards and relationships she does as she wants and a man can not influence this in any way, but she wants to enslave a man and deprive him of everything he has. And in the “Concubine” scheme, the man has all the trumps and he has full control over the situation
- The price of $ 100 for a milf and $ 200 for a younger woman is available to many men. To buy a milf for $ 100 per month, you need an income of at least $ 500, for many men this is more than realistic, many earn more
- To determine the price for giving up parental rights, look at how much surrogacy costs in your region, most likely from $ 5,000 to $15,000. But since you will allow the mother to communicate with the child, although of course you do not need to give any written guarantees for this, then you have the right to reduce the price by at least a third
- Unlike marriage, this scheme allows you to simultaneously get a happy fatherhood for a long period of time, not to lose freedom, peace of mind and the opportunity to achieve other life goals. There are simply no other ways to get it all at the same time with matriarchy and vaginocapitalism. If you know about them, then share the information
- So that your child is not taken away from you, you need to achieve a complete legal waiver of a woman's parental rights to your child. It is a complete rejection. Even partially leaving her the rights to the child, you are at great risk. Do not be lazy, make everything legally correct as far as possible, this will save you from a huge number of problems in the future that your concubine can create for you
- I think you don't have to remind me how important a DNA paternity test is, make sure you do it
- The surrounding women, upon learning that you are using this scheme, will put pressure on you. But always remember that they are vaginocapitalists and defend their ability to set the price for their vagina alone, and they put pressure on you because you set the price yourself and they see this as a danger for themselves, because if they allow this idea to spread, then their parasitism on men will be very difficult
- We did not create a vagina market, and we did not force women to sell themselves, women do it themselves, we are only trying to buy a vagina at an adequate price. And it is not necessary to say that we are so cynical, we do not look at the soul of a woman, on the contrary, it is women who are very cynical and look at men exclusively utilitarianly and we just have to maneuver in such conditions
- Our goal is not the most beautiful women, but the most affordable and with whom there will be the least problems. That is, they are middle-aged white milfs, young filipinas and black panthers. You should not chase the best genes, just good genes and the absence of genetic problems are enough
- It is important to set the right price, because an inflated price will create a constant financial burden for you. But the low price will attract scammers
- When bidding, remember that a woman gets a lot of things besides this money, she gets motherhood, security and at least basic protection, these things also have value, no matter how women try to devalue them. It's all your efforts, energy and time of your life that you spend on her and yet you can't even get a guarantee of loyalty from her.
- Do not see each other for cosmetics and processed photos. Realize that from the very first date she is trying to deceive you by improving her appearance, do not forget about it later, this should be taken into account when assessing the level of trust in her
- Write down all the conditions on paper, especially if you want to have children, it will save you from a lot of problems. It is enough to write the terms by hand in two copies or print them out. Both put their signatures and write by hand the full name, surname, patronymic, date of birth, passport details and the current date
- A woman will definitely change the terms of the contract, will try to manipulatively force you to include in the contract itself the conditions she needs or formulations that can be interpreted in two ways. She will also slowly change the conditions over time to the best for herself and the worst for you, will impose extra responsibility on you and throw various tasks on you, and in the end it may turn out that you pay her money and also do her housework and various errands for her, and bear extra responsibility for her, which was not originally intended. Keep track of it and don't let her get impudent
- A few words about love. Women use love for the purpose of manipulating and disarming men, this is a powerful technique to get everything a woman wants from a man. Women are never sincere with the men they are building relationships with, you will never know if she really loves you or is pretending to get what she needs from you. But even if it seemed to you that she sincerely loves you now, then with a very high degree of probability it can be argued that this will pass in just a few months and after that she will begin to consider you exclusively utilitarian. The biggest mistake men make is to think that a woman's love will last a lifetime, love for a lifetime for their partner happens mostly only in men. And with the widespread spread of feminism nowadays, many women have lost the ability to love at all.
- It may seem that by paying women money, we are feeding vaginocapitalism. But this is not the case, we are actually fighting with him, because we bring down the price and make sex with a woman and having children available to many men. If this idea of the “Concubine” scheme spreads, then a much cheaper and more accessible market for vaginas may be formed. This idea is almost as good as the idea of incels, in particular Alexei Celestial about sex communism, only in my opinion it is more realistic and solves the problem of lack of sex right now and you do not need to wait for sex communism to come, maybe it will not come at all. Don't get me wrong here, I actually feel good about incels and about Alexei himself, I just don't agree with some of their ideas and offer my own, in my opinion, more effective ones.

The concubine scheme is designed to meet your personal needs. But if you spread this idea among other free men and this idea becomes popular, then you will help many men become happier, have children, become happy fathers and get sex with a woman at an affordable price, you will help with increasing the birth rate of your nation, you will make the world a better place and you will counteract feminism, the purpose of which is to take under birth control, because, no matter what feminists lie that men allegedly imprisoned women in kitchen slavery, in fact, they were imprisoned in this type of slavery by their natural ability to give birth and bear children and the liberation of women, which feminism says is actually the liberation of women from having children, all this freedom of women is connected exclusively with the refusal to give birth to children, and not with the fact that supposedly evil men drove them into the kitchen, this is there is the whole essence of feminism.

By spreading the idea of the Concubine scheme, you will help even women. Women who have fallen for the lies of feminism deprive themselves of the joy of motherhood, they are saturated with hatred for men, they are deprived of the opportunity to love, because feminism is the ideology of lesbian man-hating women, not heterosexual women. Women who support feminism have exchanged their realization through children for hedonism, for the constant pursuit of pleasure and material benefits. And by spreading the idea of the "Concubine" scheme, you counteract the destructive effect of feminism and prevent feminism from destroying the human race, you help increase the birth rate, and therefore the survival of your nation and all mankind.

In general, in order to survive under the matriarchy themselves and also achieve their life goals and even make the world a better place, I suggested the “Concubine” scheme to you, as you rate it, write in the comments.

And of course you are interested in the question of whether I have tried to do what I am talking about. Yes, I tried, but so far only without having children, I immediately offered similar conditions to the woman, she agreed and it was the most comfortable relationship in my life. If I'm going to have children, I want to do it this way, using the “Concubine” scheme that I developed and shared with you today.
