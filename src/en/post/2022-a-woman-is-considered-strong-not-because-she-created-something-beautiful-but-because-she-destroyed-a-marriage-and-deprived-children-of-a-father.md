Have you ever noticed that women consider themselves strong if she left her husband, took away her children and property and convinced herself and her surroundings that she is a strong woman, a heroic mother and only she knows best what her children need. And she's done it all by going to a psychologist to convince herself of that and liking feminist memes that validate her choices.

That is, she is strong not because she has created something useful for society, founded a project, develops science and brings culture to the masses. And she is strong because she has begun to conform to the image of a "strong woman" which is very fashionable now and carries under it only - the destruction of marriage, to make children and ex-husband unhappy and with the help of psychology to solve her problems of conscience.

But at the same time she thinks that she is doing something very important, and the craziest thing is that she is sure that she is making the children happy. That's why, by the way, she shoves children into all kinds of clubs, tends to overdevelop children, is aggressive towards teachers who "misbehave", overprotects children, etc., in general, everything that will leave severe psychological traumas in children.
