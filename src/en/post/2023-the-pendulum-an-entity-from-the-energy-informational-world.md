title: The pendulum. An entity from the energy-informational world
date: 2023-08-15T00:00-03:00
description: The pendulum, also known as the egregor, is an entity from the energy-informational world created by our energy-informational bodies. We are interested in it, since the most gigantic pendulums form systems that enslave us, and all together they form a gigantic social system in which we do not live freely and suffering, only occasionally feeling happiness. Having understood how the pendulum works, we will have the key to understanding the system, and therefore getting out of it and gaining unconditional personal freedom, as well as the right to happiness.

I borrowed the term "pendulum" from the esoteric teaching "Reality Transurfing"; in other teachings, it is called [egregore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore). From the perspective of social group psychology, this phenomenon can also be explained, although it seems that something is missing, some connecting link or glue that binds everything together. This is exactly what I want to find by combining psychology with esotericism.

From an esoteric point of view, pendulums are completely ordinary and natural entities that are an integral part of our world, but they exist in the energy-information field and, consequently, are not visible to most of us. However, we see them through the effects of pendulums, through how they manifest in the mental and physical world and how they affect large masses of people.

## How to see a pendulum?

We can see it with our vision and mind, it is:

- A school of fish, a flock of birds, or a herd of animals - from an esoteric point of view, this is a pendulum. We see it through the behavior of animals that gather in a herd or school, which behaves as a separate entity
- Among humans, pendulums are easily seen in subcultures - hippies, goths, hipsters, anime fans, bikers, hikikomori, and others
- Fashion - each fashion trend is also a separate pendulum, inclining people to wear what's currently in fashion instead of what's comfortable
- Political parties, states, social and religious organizations, corporations - these are all pendulums too

Even a small group of people, even just two people engaged in one project, is a pendulum. However, we are considering giant pendulums with millions of followers because they are mostly destructive and form a system that enslaves us and deprives us of choice, independence, and the ability to independently choose our fate and our life.

## What is a pendulum?

A pendulum is an entity from the energy-information world that is created by our energy-information bodies, but it becomes independent of us, and moreover, can control and enslave us.

In fact, it's hard to say whether a pendulum is as conscious a being as we are. Most likely, it's just a natural phenomenon that keeps people under control through **instinctive and unconscious behavior**. The key word here is unconscious. And this means that since we, unlike fish or animals, have consciousness, we can consciously get out from under the influence of these pendulums, moreover, consciously influence them, making some pendulums (the ones we need) stronger and others weaker.

We may not be able to directly control already established large and aggressive pendulums, except by influencing the number of their followers. But we can create and support new model pendulums that work only for the benefit of people, although there aren't many of them yet, and they are still weak.

## How a pendulum differs from a destructive idea

It may seem that a destructive idea, for example, feminism, is the same as a pendulum. But not quite.

A pendulum is any group of people thinking in one direction who have unconsciously created a pendulum in the energy-information world. It begins to live its own life and has its own goals.

A destructive idea, on the other hand, is the representation of large pendulums in the mental world. Pendulums influence people's minds, which are also at the mental level, through destructive ideas. That's why we can see destructive ideas well with our minds, although they are not very visible to people in the system, but are clearly visible to free and developed people.

## Destructive idea

Regarding the goals of destructive ideas, they are usually false. Destructive ideas disguise themselves as good ideas, declare good goals, and, accordingly, hide their true goals to gain more followers.

For example, few people would want to join feminism if they knew the truth that it's a man-hating movement aimed at depriving men of rights. But if the victim thinks it's a movement for women's rights, it already sounds noble. That's why even many men join it, and the vast majority of women support it in one way or another.

But not all ideas are 100% destructive like feminism. There are those that bring benefits. For example, capitalism - at best, the ratio of benefit to harm is 50/50, although this can certainly be debated. The same applies to states; we have already come to terms with their dominance over us and have completely forgotten about very progressive ideas of anarchism.

But it's important to understand that there are no 100% beneficial ideas among pendulums of the old model - 50/50 is the best one can hope for.

100% beneficial or close to that ideas already belong to pendulums of the new model, such as the Open Source movement, crowdfunding, or the Esperanto language. Even cryptocurrency is 100% beneficial in its core ideology, although it's a different matter how some people use it. These are very encouraging sprouts of a new era that are breaking through capitalism, the domination of fat bankers and states - like plants growing through asphalt.

> Unfortunately, I cannot attribute the men's movement to pendulums of the new model due to its broad support for patriarchy, which belongs to destructive ideas, as sad as it may sound. But in masculism, you can find progressive sprouts that over time can gain a separate life in the form of a good idea already based on a pendulum of the new model.

In general, we use the term destructive idea for the largest pendulums that form a social system that enslaves almost all of humanity and makes people unhappy. And we simply call a "idea" or "good idea" a useful idea related to pendulums of the new model.

## How pendulums are formed

Pendulums are created by us, by our energy-information imprints. When two or more people start thinking in one direction, they, as it were, tune into each other's waves in the energy-information world, mutually reinforce each other, and as a result, create a third entity - a pendulum, due to synergy.

[Synergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy) is when 1 + 1 is more than 2. That is, when two people start thinking in one direction, they create a third independent entity. For example, such entities as "WE" in lovers, a group of like-minded people, a biker club, a legal entity, and similar small associations.

## One person can be a slave to many pendulums

One person can be a supporter of a large number of ideas, and consequently, pendulums, which is usually the case. And to each of them, a person gives their energy. And each large pendulum that has grown to the level of a system places the victim in its game, filled with illusions that distort the victim's vision at a certain angle of view.

And since there are many pendulums, there are many distortions. It is because of this that many people, if you listen to them, seem to live in some other world, and they have never seen the real world.

## Pendulums can merge

According to the law of synergy, pendulums can stick together, merge completely or partially with each other, form some other pendulums, and they all form a giant social system. Therefore, it is quite difficult to determine the boundaries of pendulums, but their destructive ideas have quite clear boundaries, and we distinguish pendulums precisely by their ideas.

We also determine characteristics and distinguish followers by ideas, since the pendulums themselves are essentially completely identical and primitive, but their destructive ideas can be very extensive, versatile, and have different characteristics.

## Symbiosis

And some pendulums can form a mutually beneficial symbiosis.

This is most clearly seen in the example of feminism, which has formed a symbiosis with LGBT, which without feminism would have had little chance of success. LGBT supplied feminism with its supporters, and also opened access to new supporters that feminism could not previously count on. And LGBT received a boost in development, energy, and also a set of new supporters. You will hardly find a feminist who doesn't support LGBT, and a person from LGBT who doesn't support feminism. Accordingly, a new supporter will support both ideas at once.

That's why I'm surprised by people and groups that have declared a fight against LGBT but not against feminism. This is absolutely meaningless.

## Disappearance of a pendulum

Just as pendulums are created, they also disappear - if fish from a school swim in different directions, the pendulum will disappear. Similarly, if people stop supporting some idea behind which a pendulum stands, it will disappear.

- For example, the once popular Emo subculture, as soon as it lost its supporters, simply ceased to exist
- Or an example from the fashion world - in 2022, a huge number of women wore identical green dresses, but in the following year, almost no one wore them anymore, which means the pendulum died

## The goal of pendulums

It seems that a destructive idea has different goals and some even seem good. But in fact, it's all illusions for recruiting supporters and keeping people under control.

The pendulum itself has only one single goal - to recruit followers; no pendulum has any other goals.

Followers are its life, and it feeds on the energy of its victims. Without followers, there will be no pendulum itself.

## War of pendulums

Pendulums that are in the same plane or occupy, as it were, one frequency of thought vibration compete with each other. One person can be under the influence of many pendulums, but never under the influence of competing pendulums.

The largest pendulums are the most aggressive - they harshly deal with competitors, and can also harshly enslave new followers.

For example, let's take religion in the past - these were the most gigantic pendulums, and they fiercely competed, organized holy wars, crusades, and did many other bad things. But at present, world religions are quite harmless, as they don't have as many followers as they used to. Accordingly, if they gain followers again, they will become aggressive again.

For example, I'll give the most obvious wars of pendulums

- Democracy and dictatorship
- Brand wars, for example, Apple and Samsung
- Wars between states
- Wars between religions
- The struggle between Democrats and Republicans in the USA

But there is not always an opposing side; the same feminism rules people's minds undividedly, as it has no strong competitor - patriarchy is already a dying pendulum, and the men's movement, unfortunately, has not yet gained great strength, and what is even more sad, there is a reverse process, a process of decomposition due to lack of supporters.

## The pendulum is the basis of the system

Each system is a complex of a pendulum, a destructive idea, a system game full of illusions, system traps, an exit, and a whirlwind of illusions before the exit. Only the largest pendulums possess all this complex, and consequently, destructive ideas and systems that generally form one giant social system according to the law of synergy.

One of the most destructive features of the system is illusions, with which they keep us under control and even carry out wars of pendulums with our hands.

People who have come out of at least one system really feel as if they have come out of the matrix, and the larger the system, the stronger this feeling.

For example, you can visit websites and groups of the men's movement or other masculist currents, where you will see that men claim they have come out of the matrix. Namely, they have come out of the system that I call "female parasitism", reinforced by feminism.

This is a very powerful and huge system, although it's not so difficult for men to get out of it (relatively, of course, getting out of any system is a complex task), which cannot be said about women. Often people who have come out of it stop and don't go further, although they have very little left to completely exit the entire social system.

The feeling of coming out of the matrix is absolutely real, along with it comes an incredible sense of freedom. Your energy returns to you - you will definitely feel it, even with undeveloped sensitivity. And along with energy, health returns; you will feel that you have become noticeably healthier than you were before, regardless of age. And the most wonderful thing - we get the right to happiness, which can become the background of our life.
