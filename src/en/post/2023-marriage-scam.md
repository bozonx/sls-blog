description: The term Marital Scam from the Men's Movement perfectly describes the model of mercantile female behavior. We need to understand it in order to come to an understanding of the system of female parasitism - one of the most gigantic systems enslaving a huge number of men and making them unhappy. To achieve freedom, we need to explore the real world, no matter how harsh it may seem. Having freed yourself from the slavery of women, you will already be more than half free.

# The Marriage Scam

The Marriage Scam is a female behavioral strategy discussed in the Men's Movement. This concept clearly demonstrates the mercenary nature of modern women.

## The Marriage Scam begins with

The entire female society has convinced men, and has been convincing them since childhood, that a man must pursue a woman, court her, tremble before her, must fear losing her, must provide for her, protect her at the cost of his life, be her supplier and a dumping ground for her negative emotions. Our mothers, kindergarten teachers, school teachers, and society as a whole convinced us of all this, even men took part in this brainwashing because their own brains were washed.

Of course, all this is ideal ground for women to ensure their easy, carefree, and wealthy life, which is provided by a man who renounces his personal goals and even rights in favor of ensuring female privileges.

A man, running after a woman and courting her, doesn't even suspect that this is not his choice; he's simply walking along a specially laid path straight into a trap. He doesn't notice that he's being directed along this path and his steps are being corrected so that he doesn't stray from it. His woman constantly consults with her mother and friends about his enslavement. And the poor fellow thinks he's such a hero - he won over a woman and she will cook him borsch. He goes to work, earns money for her, and doesn't even suspect what kind of development is going on behind his back.

Then the woman marries him. Marrying doesn't mean dragging him to the registry office by force, although this happens too, but rather means wrapping the man in a cocoon of manipulation and false information, leading him to the decision to go to the representation of hell on earth - the registry office.

After this satanic ceremony, the woman receives into her possession a personal slave, who is guaranteed to her by the state.

Moreover, if she's smart and her mother and friends have taught her well, she immediately starts earning her female capital from her very first husband. She shakes money from him under any pretext and buys real estate with it or puts money in her secret stash.

> Here we need to clarify about smart women - the phrase "smart woman" is not the same as "smart man," it doesn't mean she has broad and deep knowledge and developed thinking. A smart woman, particularly in Russia, means a woman who successfully parasitizes on a man, and if she parasitizes on several men at once, she's a real heroine whom other women admire and take as an example. Of course, we're not talking about deservedly smart women scientists and scientific figures, as there are very few of them. But even among women scientists, many received degrees simply by using men. Stories are not rare when women made dissertations using men simply by creating an illusion that sex was possible.

After getting married, a smart woman plucks the man like a lime tree. And if she lacks the intelligence to rob the first husband or there's nothing to take from him, she ends the relationship as soon as possible so that with the new man she can do everything as she was taught; her hands are just itching to apply all this female knowledge in practice.

Necessarily during the breakup, she makes sure that after her there remains a scorched desert in the man's soul and life. For women, it's terrible grief if a man can enjoy life after her.

A mercenary woman makes a man her provider, but she doesn't plan to live with him for life. She will be with him exactly until she squeezes him to the last drop, strips him to the bone, or until she simply gets bored.

And she gets bored simply because she has destroyed his personality, self-esteem, and made him a dull and boring slave. She gets tired of communicating with such a rag, even though she made him that way herself. And of course, she no longer considers that he deserves such a luxurious upgraded bitch like her; she believes she deserves better - she needs a proud man with character and backbone _(though she'll do the same to him without a shadow of regret)_.

After the woman squeezes her husband to the last drop and destroys his personality, she dumps him. But she does it in such a way as to not take responsibility. Not many women openly declare their departure. Usually, a woman starts to mess with his head so strongly and parasitize and openly cheat so much that the man can't stand it and leaves. She remains in any case in profit; firstly, the responsibility for the breakup lies with the man, and it's important for her to always remain perfect and not guilty in the eyes of other people and have the ability to blame the ex-husband in front of the children, as well as write off all her sins on him, as if nullifying them. And secondly, even if he will endure all this, it's also convenient for her - she can openly date other men, and the current man will just provide for her. A very convenient life, unfortunately, many live like this.

Having dealt with the first man, she moves on to the next one more intelligently. The first man is the one with whom she had a long-term relationship; before him, women typically had about 20 sexual partners if she's 20-22 years old. Therefore, she already has enough experience to understand what she really needs from men. By this time, she has already understood everything, her mother and friends taught her everything, and she avidly reads social media groups about manipulating men and adopts bitchy behavior models. Therefore, her next victim will be even less fortunate - she will squeeze all the juice out of him and will do it more competently and without a shadow of regret. Usually, such parasitic relationships last from three to 5 years. If relationships last more than 5 years, it's not because they're happy, but because the man agreed to endure all the woman's abuse and her adventures.

Just don't think that she will have any period of loneliness between men; she makes this transition smoothly. She builds relationships with a new deer while still in a relationship with the old deer - none of them will find out about this. Moreover, there might even be several of these deer, which is more often the case. **A woman, being in demand age, will never allow herself to be alone** - imagine that you are a factory owner, and it stops for a month or more - these are just terrible irreparable losses and lost profits. This is exactly how mercenary women reason - loneliness for them is lost profit and losses because they have to provide for themselves, which means they can no longer be lazy or work half-heartedly as they did before, because expenses become equal to income. And that means her stash is no longer being replenished. Worse still, she has to take money from there for household needs - this is women's worst nightmare - spending their own money, stolen from men, on household needs. Therefore, if you see a single woman under 35 and think she doesn't have anyone, then you just don't know everything about her; perhaps she has her personal deer chorus and it's more profitable for her to receive benefits from many men at once and not enter into serious relationships with someone, because this would greatly limit her opportunities.

Accordingly, married women gradually start looking for their next victim after a couple of years of marriage. Of course, they will tell you that their husband didn't pay attention and everything on the list. Therefore, after about 3 years of marriage, a woman starts actively taking care of herself and spending a lot of money on clothes and cosmetics, naturally her husband's money. And in general, if it's said that a woman spends money on something, it almost always means that she's spending not her money, but a man's money. Surely you've observed such a transformation in your environment - a year or two after the wedding, a friend's wife started wearing tight leggings and putting on makeup. Of course, she'll lie that she got tired of being a dowdy which her husband made her into, she wants to be a lady, not a housewife. But I think you understand the true reason.

But also don't think that she's with this man forever. She has already understood that there is no need to live with one man until the end of life because even in old age she will have a string of admirers and will never be alone. And if this doesn't happen in her region, she will go to Turkey or Egypt where even the oldest women have simply amazing success with local men, which young women can only dream of. And so they jump until deep old age. In Turkey, I personally saw such elderly women who deceived unfortunate Turks for money and lived at the expense of fooled men. In Egypt, it's the same, although women go there rather just for sex and very sugary courtship, which looks very disgusting from the side, but women just adore it.

But the tales about a glass of water in old age are invented for men. A woman doesn't worry about this because she raises children in such a way that they serve her in old age. And at the same time, she instills hatred for their father so that he doesn't get any perks. So that the slave doesn't count on help in old age. Because the meaning of a slave, in her opinion, is to provide for the mistress, not to have privileges. Privileges are accordingly for the mistress.

## As a result, she has

- The joy of motherhood - 2-3 children from different fathers. Moreover, the fathers themselves don't have joy, because she uses children to manipulate the fathers' feelings, to pump money from unfortunate men and continue to parasitize on them for many years even after divorce. If she considers that he remains a good slave, she doesn't release the man from her manipulative networks for as long as possible and uses him all his life or just mocks him for fun. And if she understands that the man has figured everything out, he has figured out her manipulations and breathed the sweet air of freedom - she simply takes away his children and there's nothing this man can do anymore. She thinks only in terms of benefit - she won't get benefits from a free man, which means there's no point in giving him the opportunity to see children, and the well-being of the children themselves concerns such women least of all. Unfortunate men go to courts, to the guardianship service, to the juvenile inspection, but feminists sit everywhere there, who explain to him that he is nobody, that he is shit - if there's nothing to do - go, file as many applications as you want, all decisions will still be made in favor of the child's mother, she doesn't even need to go anywhere and be distracted by such trifles
- From each father of her children, she receives a minimum of $200 in alimony. And that's already $600 if there are three children - this is the very minimum. But often alimony amounts to $300-400 (in the post-Soviet space), for each child. I think you understand that this money goes personally into her pocket, not to the children. I personally heard stories when a sailor man, earning well, sent large alimony, and when he came to the children, it turned out that they don't even have toys. And do you know what this is called? - **this is alimony theft**, in the literal sense. I understand that this causes you bewilderment because you've been convinced that this is normal, that a woman supposedly has every right to dispose of alimony at her discretion and not report expenses to the man, and a man who made a child is equated to a criminal and to atone for his guilt must pay alimony. But in reality, the woman is the criminal and 100% of women steal alimony. There is not a single woman who would not steal alimony. And no one punishes them for this - such punishment is not provided for in the law. If you're a father, you know perfectly well that maintaining a child needs no more than $100 per month by Russian standards, and since by law you are both obligated to maintain the child, then you either shouldn't pay alimony at all, and the child can just live one week or one month with each parent as is practiced in Western countries, or you should both contribute to the maintenance of the child, which means each parent should pay no more than $50 per month, not $200 or more as it usually happens, which only the man pays anyway, while the woman doesn't invest in the child's maintenance at all. But this information is hidden from you and I hope you now understand why
- In addition to alimony, women squeeze out apartments, cars, and other property. And they often squeeze out the husband's business - after divorce, it suddenly turns out that according to documents she is either the owner of the ex-husband's business or has the right to a significant share in the property and the husband is obliged to pay her dividends, even though she was never in the office and doesn't even know what the company is called. And women also put spokes in the wheels to mock, as some decisions must be made by all owners and the man has to grovel considerably to beg her to sign documents that she should sign anyway
- This is all not fiction, of course, in groups on masculine topics you will find many tragic stories of men. I personally know a man who earned a four-room apartment which his wife squeezed out of him and now she lives in his apartment with her lover and children whom she imposed the lover on as a father, while presenting the real father to the children as a stranger
- And of course, a woman has lots of free sex without the need to achieve it and sacrifice anything - she can even cheat and nothing will happen to her for it, she will even be respected, because she fought for her love, and her husband was a villain who interfered with their love - everything is just like in women's TV series. Compare with a man who to get sex needs to become a slave, take on a mass of unnecessary obligations and responsibilities and give his life under complete control. And male infidelity leads to complete collapse - the woman will take everything from him. Absolutely all women without exception have the easiest and free access to sex - it doesn't matter beautiful - not beautiful, thin - fat, even if disabled - she just needs to raise her hand and deer will run from all corners, even come from other cities and even countries or pay for her flight. But it's extremely difficult for a man to get free sex, and if he's not rich, not endowed with physique or, God forbid, disabled - then he won't see free sex without obligations

In general, as you understood, women get just tons of perks which provide them with a wealthy, carefree, and easy life. But of course, they don't provide it themselves, but do it at the expense of men.

But the saddest thing is that it's not enough for them that men are willing to give their benefits themselves - women want to take them away, they want to tear them out of their hands, they want to destroy men's personality and psyche and leave behind a desert burned with napalm.

In general, welcome to the real world - reality needs to be known even though it's not as rosy as the world of illusions. It's still better in the real world, whatever it may be. Although I think if you're an adult man then you've encountered all this yourself and felt it on your own skin.

## Female parasitism

And now a bit of esotericism to understand how women come to such a complex and multi-move strategy while not even building any far-sighted plans and not developing strategies independently.

Earlier we talked about [pendulums](2023-the-pendulum-an-entity-from-the-energy-informational-world), also known as egregores - these are esoteric entities from the energy-informational world _(if you prefer a more scientific approach, then you can look at them through the prism of [swarm consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence))_. At the mental level, they have their representation in the form of a destructive idea. And the largest pendulums form systems that place victims in their game, filled with illusions to keep them under their control and feed on their energy.

So female parasitism is just that - both a pendulum and a destructive idea and a very large system. However, this is a natural system without favorites, without hierarchy, without a clear socio-political program, unlike, for example, feminism, which obviously is an artificially created system.

In this game, there are 2 roles - mistress and slave, and accordingly, for each role, there is its own set of illusions. Therefore, a man and a woman discussing the same objective phenomena don't understand each other and seem to speak different languages - because their mind's vision is distorted by different illusions.

But that's not all. In addition to illusions, there is also information that women draw from the energy-informational field, which the pendulum gives them in the necessary form. In general, the Marriage Scam strategy is this information that seems to be created by the entire female society as a whole. All women seem to invest in the development of this idea without even understanding its essence and not seeing it entirely.

And the woman's friends and mother are the voice of this system, through them it speaks. And this happens at an unconscious level - what the system says through them they don't always realize themselves and may not even remember what they just said.

And the man doesn't suspect anything - he lives in the illusion that he's building an ideal family, investing in it, building relationships, making compromises, and earning money for the family.

## Strategy Application

As I mentioned earlier, most women think in the moment and don't want to think strategically, not because they can't _(after all, there are women politicians and business leaders)_, but simply because they don't want to strain their brain unnecessarily. And without strategy, it's impossible to live successfully.

And to solve this problem, it turns out that all women have created a ready-made model of behavior for themselves, and every woman can simply blindly adopt it, without understanding the details, and still prosper without even engaging their brain for a second.

The Marriage Scam Strategy is exactly such a complex strategy, created entirely by female society. And to apply it, you don't even need to know about it - you just copy and act in the moment each time, applying specific small behavioral programs in each specific situation that work well with momentary desires and emotions - these programs are based on them and of course provide momentary benefits in the form of pleasure and other perks.

And overall, despite all the resulting chaos, it turns out quite well - a carefree, easy and comfortable life. And all thanks to this strategy that the entire female society invented. The greatest contribution was made by female influencers, but the main thing is that everyone else can live successfully without rising above the level of animal thinking.

## The Price of Stupidity

But the price for stupidity, for unwillingness to develop, for prioritizing momentary benefits and base pleasures is the denial of access to happiness. It appears sometimes, but over time becomes almost completely blocked. Some women have made such a mess that happiness is no longer possible, while others have been visited by mental maturity.

## Women's Reason

If reason comes to take the helm in a woman, she begins to think in terms of benefit, and reason locks the soul away, because the soul wants something different than reason, and it's the soul that gives happiness. So in this regard, I disagree with the common opinion in the men's movement that women never use reason at all.

Reason doesn't come to everyone, but those women who do receive it come to the idea of female capital - they don't want to just spend their husband's money wastefully, but save it for their own capital or secret mortgage.

It's important to understand that such women aren't particularly concerned about their lack of happiness - they perfectly understand what they're getting by sacrificing happiness. The soul of course scratches and causes discomfort out of nowhere, but the woman no longer hears it and drowns this discomfort in base pleasures such as creating scandals, cheating, infuriating men, and getting their dose of base high. It doesn't solve the problem, but helps silence the soul temporarily.

## Conclusion for Men

For men, an illusion is created that he can build a family and that creating a family is important for him. In reality, with a modern woman, building the family that a man wants - where love, harmony, justice, mutual respect and understanding reign - is **impossible**, it's all an illusion. There simply aren't women with whom you can build the kind of family that every man dreams of.

A man believing this illusion becomes a slave from the start, moreover, he puts in a lot of effort to find his mistress. And after divorce, men discover with surprise that only they invested in the relationship, while the woman only destroyed it and didn't care about it. Because for her, he was just a resource.

The saddest thing is that after divorce, the man is left with nothing, and often with a bunch of obligations.

Yet he worked so hard and earned so much that this money would have been enough to live comfortably without working until the end of his life, but it will be his ex-wife who will live comfortably without working. And she will impose a new father on the children, and teach them to hate their real father, and consequently, there won't be any of that much-desired care in old age, and judging by men's life expectancy, not everyone will even live to see deep old age.

Draw your own conclusions. But I believe there is no need for men to get involved in all this because we get nothing but illusions, while the stakes are very high - it's our life and our happiness and of course freedom. And women get everything - money, apartments, cars, passive income provided by ex-husbands, and children who will take care of them in old age. The only thing women don't get is happiness, but that's the least of their concerns.

And I also want to protect you from a common opinion in the Men's Movement that supposedly the man is to blame for everything. If we think this way, then we're making the victim guilty of fraud against themselves and removing guilt from the fraudster. And marriage scam, especially female capital, is definitely fraud and even theft of both alimony and property. Therefore, don't reverse justice and call things by their proper names. And if you still think that the victim is to blame for the fraud, then you are making the world you live in worse and less fair with your own hands. Fraud victims should be treated with sympathy and men should be helped by telling the truth about fraudsters. And the fraudsters themselves should be treated with contempt - then everything will fall into place, primarily in your head.
