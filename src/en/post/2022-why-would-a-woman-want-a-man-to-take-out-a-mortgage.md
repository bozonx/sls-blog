The main goal is to gain complete control over a man. Roughly speaking, to hold him by the balls. And also, which is even more important, in case of divorce to get half or all of the apartment without having invested anything in it.

### Of course she can say what she wants to say ###

- "We need to live somewhere like normal people, enough with the rented apartments. We've got to build our own family nest.
- It's better to take a mortgage, so at least you pay yourself, not someone else's uncle and in 20 years you'll have your own apartment.
- Everybody lives in their own apartment, everybody takes out a mortgage.
- You have to be an adult and take responsibility.
- Only dishonest people can buy an apartment, and we honest people should take out a mortgage or we'll be left without an apartment.
- Our two salaries will be enough for the mortgage and we'll still have some money to live on.
- You need an apartment to feel at home, you can't live without it. You can do whatever you want in it, make any repairs, not like in a rented one.

Sounds reasonable. And, unfortunately, many men fall for these tricks. But in fact, behind all this is hidden terrible and cruel manipulations that can completely destroy a man's life and make it unbearable.

## A woman takes control of a man

- If a couple takes out a mortgage, it is a guarantee that the man from his wife will not go anywhere, will be completely under her control. She does not need to play the loving wife, she can not be shy and reveal her true face of a bitch and he will have to accept it, nowhere to go.
- She'll replace the man's goals. He will no longer dream of opening his own business, it is too risky. For a wife, the main thing is stability, a stable, predictable salary. She argues the risk of opening her own business as follows: What if it doesn't work out? - How will I pay the mortgage?!
- Joint children are a guarantee that she'll keep the apartment. Men are convinced that it is customary to leave the apartment to a woman when divorcing, as it is necessary for the children. We were also convinced that only a woman is considered the guardian of the children and only she takes care of the children's future. And of course leaving the apartment to the wife and leaving with nothing is considered a very noble gesture.
- When she says that in 20 years she will have her own apartment, she gives no guarantees that she will remain a faithful and good wife and the marriage will be happy. And no guarantee at all that a man can live in that apartment and she won't kick him out.
- When she says that you can only earn money for an apartment by not being honest, she is kind of implying that the man is a beggar, that he will never be able to earn money for an apartment. If you want to be honest, be a beggar (of course this is a lie). She does everything possible to make the man believe all this and not even try to do business and other risky activities. Then he will remain completely under her control, will earn controlled money, which he by the way will not see, all will be taken away by her under various pretexts
- She gets complete control over the man. She allows him to do only what is profitable for her, not what he wants.
- She will protect her husband from friends, there is a good excuse - it is necessary to pay the mortgage, and not spend money on outings with friends. The same goes for hobbies.
- She will make a slave out of a man, and the mortgage itself will help her to do it.
- She'll keep him busy so he doesn't have any free time. Repairs, fixing the car, shopping with her, etc. It's a guarantee for her that he won't cheat because he won't have time for it.
- Of course, no fight for men's rights, participation in the political and social life of the country or city is out of the question. A man has to pay the mortgage, not "do stuff". And that makes a man disempowered, unambitious and weak. Let me remind you that participation in public life and influence on the outside world is the destiny of free and strong men.

The trick of manipulation is that the man, as it were, decided to take a mortgage, and not she induced him to do so. So she removes the responsibility and gets control over him and after that there can be no claims to her, he "himself" decided it.

I want you to understand what a mortgage is when it is induced by a woman: A man makes a real decision with real money and obligations for the sake of an ephemeral vision of the future, which his wife imposes on him with the help of cunning manipulations.
