Let's take a look at how women in general correct male behavior, appearance and what techniques they use.

The techniques are primitively simple - ridicule, humiliation of undesirable behavior and style of dress, while encouraging men's behavior and appearance that is beneficial for women. Of course, this is a very destructive influence on us, as many men are persecuted undeservedly and it greatly affects our choices and our life line and whether we live as we want or obey the demands of women. And no matter how primitive this manipulation is, it is still not visible to most men.

&gt; Men who are under the manipulation of women and do not see it are referred to as "Allenites".

## What women adjust men to their own way:

- They call men who don't spend rashly on women greedy. And they call men who pour money into women like a black hole generous and honorable.
- They ridicule men who have been able to figure out women's manipulations. For example, they attack masculists very harshly and aggressively.
- Men who know the truth about feminism (that feminism is not about women's rights, but hatred of men and a movement to take away men's rights) are rigidly booed in the collective and society. Feminists turn people against these men and call them crazy or gay
- Women encourage men who spend the best years of their lives working out and walking around with their arms spread wide and generally acting like dumb dorks. And they despise men who don't act like that and do self-development for themselves instead of working out for women.
- On the one hand women demean gays and men who have adopted some of women's behaviors. But on the other side feminists use gays to enhance their crazy movement and may support gays if they benefit from it
- Women encourage the gopnik style of dress, the classic suit, the military suit, etc. But they don't really encourage the style that is just comfortable for us - a plain t-shirt, jeans or shorts without frills, plain socks, sneakers or sandals. By the way, this is how not only poor men dress (according to women), but also how rich and free men walk around
- Women encourage that a man's whole life is built around a woman. But they despise free men who live for themselves.
- Women encourage favorable for them attitudes in men - a woman is always right, it is better not to argue with a woman, a man should marry and make a woman happy. And they despise men who do not have these attitudes, calling them misogynists, gays and resentful of women.

The list goes on and on, but I think you get the main point - women, by constant pressure on society, have managed to make the world very comfortable for themselves. Women have forced men to submit to their rules and strive to meet women's standards of a real man. And if someone doesn't conform, they will receive pain that not everyone can bear, such as being banished from the community, becoming a loner against the majority. The rebel will be labeled as abnormal, humiliated through sexuality, claiming that women just don't give him any. Women turn society against free men.

The problem is that women have created an unjust world convenient only for themselves, but very inconvenient for men, especially for free men. In [next article](2022-fixing-women-s-world) talk about how we can counter this and how we ourselves can influence the world.
