One of the areas of the Personal Freedom System is digital freedom. At the initial stage it may not seem as important for many people as financial freedom and freedom in relationships, but it will be great to think about it now. Because digital freedom gives you that extraordinarily high feeling of freedom, once you feel it, you will never want to go back to the slavery of the system. It's hard to put it into words, it's like a feeling of awareness and even some kind of spiritual enlightenment, you just have to feel it. Of course, not only digital freedom can cause this unforgettable feeling, but also other directions, but now we will talk about digital freedom.

## First of all, let's understand what we're going to get

- Complete control over our digital lives.
- Get rid of almost all surveillance by Google, Yandex, Apple, Microsoft and others.
- We get rid of much of the surveillance by the government. Your personal comrade major will be tearing his hair out trying to get any information about you. True there is a little spoonful of tar: from tracking your location is extremely difficult to get rid of when using a cell phone
- Your portrait in Big Data will be incomplete, fragmented, and irrelevant. Yes, you will receive not very relevant targeting ads, but your data is not leaking out without your knowledge. If you did not know: corporations like Google and Yandex know literally everything, know about your every step and movement, they collect gigabytes of data about you, it is equivalent to the fact that you in every window is an employee of the corporation or comrade major and will record your every move
- Get rid of the wiretaps. Hopefully it's no secret that your phone is listening to you on a regular basis and analyzing what you're talking about to compile a complete digital portrait of you to provide personalized advertising. So you don't have to tape the camera, it's more important to control the microphone.
- Get rid of censorship. We see how unfair the blocking of many Internet resources is and censorship in Russia has gained a terrible momentum. We, free people, can't put up with this and we want to exercise our constitutional right to unhindered access to information.
- Let's get freedom

You will have to do a little bit of fiddling and understand some technical aspects, but don't let that scare you, I will try to present the information to you in the most understandable language and so that you can achieve at least a basic level of digital freedom even without a serious technical background.

In the next article on digital freedom, we will talk about the levels of digital freedom and what you need to do to achieve it.
