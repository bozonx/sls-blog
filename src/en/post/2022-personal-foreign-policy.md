Just as states have their internal and external policies to influence the situation inside and outside the country in a certain way, we also have our personal policies. However, we have only external policy, and internal policy is self-development (since in the internal direction we can only influence ourselves).

Most people influence the world chaotically, sometimes good, sometimes bad. Often strong political, spiritual and social ideas are broadcast through them, but they don't even realize it. And not always these strong ideas have a positive effect on the world and on specific people. An ordinary person does not control and does not care about his external influence, because it seems to him insignificant and not worth worrying about.

## Here is an example: (I will not touch on political or religious issues for now).

Let's take a more understandable example: concern for the environment. If people throw trash on a wild beach and if no one cleans it up (e.g. volunteers), then after a while it will be impossible to rest on it. And every person who threw garbage, contributed to it, someone contributed 0.001% of garbage, and someone 10% and both had a direct impact on the littering of the area, and indirectly. The indirect effect is that it is easier for other people to cross the moral threshold and litter where there is already litter, which increases the effect. It also blurs the responsibility - the responsibility is on someone else who produced more garbage, and I just threw away a cup. Also in the eyes of people this place changes its purpose, it is no longer a place for recreation, but a place for garbage, which increases the effect and littering occurs in geometric progression.

The same happens in the information field: destructive ideas get spread and do not seem to be something bad, as they are supported by the majority. But it is more difficult for good and truthful ideas to get through, because the truth requires knowledge, effort, and a broad outlook. In the case of littering, it is necessary to make efforts and not to give in to destructive ideas that littering is normal, but to take the garbage with you and throw it in the trash can.

And here we come to the struggle of ideas. An illustrative example is the volunteers who sometimes come to pick up trash. This is obviously a good and constructive idea, but not as strong as the destructive idea of littering.

## Why does it even concern us?

We are free people, we control our lives, we control what ideas we broadcast and support so that we don't become the mouthpiece of destructive ideas. And we are well versed in manipulation and lies, so we can distinguish between false ideas and good ones. We see how destructive ideas badly affect our life and make it worse.

For example, the ideas of feminism and female parasitism make the life of every Russian man and woman worse. And the most interesting thing is that the ideas of feminism and female parasitism make even the life of women themselves worse. But women will defend these ideas to the froth of their mouths, because they believe in them with all their souls, or rather did not resist that these ideas penetrated into the core of their personality and became part of their personality. I hope you, my dear readers, have no illusions that feminism fights for women's rights.

&gt; Spoiler: in short, feminism fights for the deprivation of men's rights and the shifting of responsibility onto them.

The consequences of supporting feminism for women are: broken relationships that were once wonderful, unsettled lives; the belief that men are to blame for everything and therefore they implicitly or explicitly hate and distrust them, which ensures that they will never have a happy relationship. Children don't see their fathers, fathers don't see their children and both suffer. Fathers pay insane child support without even getting a report on how the money was spent. That is the absolutely destructive influence of feminist ideas on society, not a single positive point for anyone.

### So our personal foreign policy gives us

- Explicitly influence the world, even if just a little bit.
- Indirectly influence the world by promoting good and true ideas.
- Helping other people to start supporting good ideas
- Our conscience is clear and we are honest with ourselves and others
- Personal foreign policy can substitute for personal mission than solves the problem of emptiness in life and soul
- You become a whole person and gain control over yourself and your life
- That great feeling that you have made the world a little better.

It may not seem important now while you have a lot of personal problems, but in time you'll get over it all, solve your financial and relationship problems and then personal politics and/or mission will come to the forefront.

Good luck to all!
