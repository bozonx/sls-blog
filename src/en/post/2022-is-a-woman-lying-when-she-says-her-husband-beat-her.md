I think a lot of people have heard tearful stories from women they know about their ex beating her. And, surprisingly, all these stories are like two drops of water. The gist of them is this: the ex just out of the blue took a swing at her and hit her, and she just sat there and did nothing. Doesn't that sound suspicious to you? Let's look into it.

## She determines what constitutes aggression herself

For example, if a couple is playing around and may hit each other for fun, a punch from the woman would never be considered aggression, but a punch from the man would be considered aggression, depending on how the woman interprets it. So if a woman claims he hit her, we can't reliably know if the hit was part of their sexual play or if the hit was intended to cause damage. Women certainly claim that he meant to harm her. But we never know that for sure.

## The very word "hit" carries a negative connotation

The implication is that the aggressor hits the victim undeservedly. That is why women use this word and never say that they themselves provoked the blow.

## They also say that men hit children

They mean that a man hits a child out of the blue. But in fact it is very rare, and it is women who hit children out of the blue, I have personally seen it many times. And to cover it up they have trained us to think of men as aggressors towards women and children. And no one even dares to think that a woman can hit a child undeservedly.

## Women asserting their right to hit men unilaterally

For example, a response to a woman's punch would be considered aggression, but an initial punch from a woman is not considered aggression. Manipulation is like this: - "can a woman hit a man? It's just a tickle, nothing more."

Although if she has a knife or other weapon in her hand, the blow can be fatal. But women have taught the whole society to take a woman's blow as something not serious.

The saddest thing is that a man can not even go to the police, his statement will not be accepted, and they will ridicule him. And if a man retaliates with a blow, then when a woman calls the police, they will immediately rush to the scene. Double standards, that's what women love.

By the way, remember the image of a woman with a rolling pin or a frying pan who punishes a man for something - it is considered something funny, although these tools can kill.

## But there are really rare cases when a man "beats" a woman.

When a man is dominant in a relationship, hitting and threatening to hit can be used as a method of getting a woman to behave appropriately. But here too we need to be critical, as the woman initially wanted an alpha male, rough and aggressive, they find it sexy. Should we condemn this behavior of a man? After all, she got what she dreamed of. Unlike men who dream of a kind and caring woman, but get an aggressive manipulator.
