title: Introduction to the philosophical model of the System of Personal Freedom
date: 2023-07-16T00:00-03:00
description: The system of Personal Freedom is designed for developed people who seek to know themselves and the world around them, who are cramped in the world of ordinary people and who do not want to live their gray lives. Freedom is especially important for men, as the system is based on their enslavement. We will understand what skills need to be developed, understand the global model of the universe, understand the logic of global processes, get rid of illusions, manipulators and prejudices. All this and much more will eventually take us out of the system.

>  Disclaimer right away: the Personal Freedom System is neither a spiritual nor an esoteric teaching and does not promote any spiritual or esoteric teachings. I state this upfront because today we will take the first step towards personal freedom, and for this, we will have to touch upon a part of the universe that is currently not proven by science, but information about it exists in esoteric teachings, particularly about the energy-information field, knowledge of which we need to build a philosophical model.

In fact, if you look at the philosophical models of, for example, ancient Greek philosophers, they pay considerable attention to subtle matters, as adding subtle worlds to the equation for a broad understanding of global processes in the world puts everything in its place and explains many global phenomena. Therefore, philosophical models include discussions about society and the state, as well as about spirit and soul.

Actually, for the same reason, the philosophical model of the Personal Freedom System also relies on some esoteric knowledge. More precisely, it's not that it directly relies on it, I rely exclusively on scientific knowledge, but in the part where there is no scientific knowledge, I resort to esotericism. By and large, I only take the energy-information world from esotericism. By adding it to my model, many incomprehensible phenomena, such as intuition, dreams, inspiration, flow state, the source of ideas, synergy, and other mysterious phenomena, get at least some explanation and fit well into a holistic understanding of the world.

But what interests us most is understanding global processes in the world, understanding the essence of societies, group psychology, why and how people unite their mental energy, creating groups and societies, and most importantly - understanding the so-called system from which we have to exit in order to obtain the much-desired personal freedom and regain our energy that it takes away from us.

It so happened that I was interested in esotericism for a while and still found useful knowledge among a bunch of husks and nonsense there, and I will share it with you, of course, only adequate and safe knowledge, since there is a lot of very dubious and even harmful information in esoteric teachings. For example, I have not encountered a single esoteric teaching that adequately describes the issue of money. Everywhere there are only harmful and dangerous advice: "spend like a rich person", "don't accumulate money, it's energy that should move" and other nonsense. It's not hard to guess that this is a direct road to poverty, not wealth.

## About esotericism

And there is such a trap - if a person has already believed some sound ideas with which he agrees in the teaching he is reading, then he also accepts such obviously bad ideas and advice. It turns out to be a manipulation that is used, for example, by marketers or those who conduct negotiations. It's called "3 YES": if a person said "yes" twice, then the third time he will also say "yes". That is why I urge you to be critical of esotericism, as it is not always possible to understand what is adequate there and what is not, and what is completely dangerous nonsense.

## For whom

And I also want to say: the Personal Freedom System positions itself as a society of smart people, but this does not mean that I will burden you with complex philosophical sayings. No. I try to express it as simply as possible, without unnecessary husks, only the essence itself. Therefore, the information will be understandable and accessible to all adult people, including women. Our doors are also open to them, but I don't expect much interest in personal freedom from women, as freedom is simply not interesting to most women. The system gives them very substantial privileges, which they mostly won't want to give up for the sake of some freedom.

## Men need this

But for men, the system gives nothing special except illusions. And we don't need illusions at all.

The system enslaves everyone - both women and men, but the system gives more privileges to women because they are, as it were, supervisors over men, since men are the main force holding the system and allowing it to develop. Therefore, for us men, freedom is much more valuable and sweet.

The only thing that can be valuable in the system for some men is the removal of responsibility and psychological burden for those who have done some shit in life. Outside the system, all this will come out, so they hide in the system, fearing to face their conscience. This is one of the traps of the system. Shit is primarily immoral acts that have harmed other people, bearing no punishment. Such acts, as we know, exist. For example, harm done to a person or people from socially unprotected layers of society, such as the majority of other men, or just a good person. Such evil deeds are not punishable, but they drop the villain into a trap from which it is almost impossible to get out, and he will forever remain a slave to the system.

But such men will not come here, as their minds are very clouded. These are men who took part in taking children away from their fathers, were combat simps controlled by their women, causing harm to their ex-partners, those who slept with married women, causing harm to their husbands, cheated someone out of money, those who helped establish dictatorship and enslave peoples, and other men who committed evil deeds for which **there is no punishment in society**. But those who have not committed intentional evil deeds but supported some destructive idea, they still have a chance to get out of the system.

For the rest of the men, there is absolutely no need to be a slave to the system and stay in the illusions that it generates to retain its slaves.

## Smart and developed people are not comfortable in the system

And especially developed men need to get out of the system because it will try to suppress, make suffer, create illusions in which a smart person will feel lonely and depressed, and come to the thought that maybe it's not necessary to be smart, maybe it's not worth it, maybe give up and surrender to the system, live by instincts, like an animal, as many other people do.

The system doesn't need smart people, they are less manageable and more free. Because a smart person, reflecting, will come to freedom. It is inevitable - reflections about the world and life will lead to the fact that more freedom is needed, that one wants to be free from the prison of the mind.

But a stupid person, reflecting, will come to the conclusion that he needs to be even more of a slave - take a second mortgage, get a mistress in addition to his wife, buy a car for each, be a slave to all these women, serve them and their cars that he bought them, and so on.

In general, if you are now here on the "Personal Freedom System" channel, then you are a smart person, you have thought about global things, the structure of the world, and you have felt some subtle feeling - a thin ray of freedom, or maybe you well remember that feeling of freedom that you felt in your youth, and it attracts you.

Well, you are on the right path.

Freedom is the main thing we will get. And now let's return to the philosophical model of the "Personal Freedom System", which will help us understand the global world, understand its logic, and ultimately get the much-desired freedom.

## Briefly, what the model consists of

### 7 levels of the universe

From subtle worlds to the quantum and our native physical world.

### 3 main levels

Of these, the most interesting for us are: the physical level, the mental level, and the energy-information field.

### Mental level

Of these three, the mental level is most interesting to us, that's where our mind is, and that's where the system enslaves us. Therefore, we will talk a lot about it. There are all illusions, beliefs, and everything that distorts our thinking and perception of the real and mental worlds.

### Pendulum

The pendulum belongs to the energy-information world. I took this term from the esoteric teaching "Reality Transurfing", where it is well explained, and there is no point in inventing any other terms.

The pendulum is essentially the basis of the system. There are many of these pendulums, they merge with each other, form something bigger, there are both small and gigantic pendulums, and all of them together form a large system.

### Destructive idea

This is the representation of the pendulum at the mental level, since the pendulum itself is in the energy-information world, it cannot influence the mental world where our mind is. Although in fact it can a little bit to a small extent. But its main influence goes through the destructive idea, which is its representation at the mental level. These are ideas such as social, political, such as feminism and fascism and a large number of other ideas, up to the point that the idea of using tobacco or alcohol is also a destructive idea, albeit the simplest one.

## System

There are many different systems. Each of them is characterized by having a pendulum, a destructive idea, a system game, a trap, an exit, and a vortex before the exit. If all this is present, then we can say that it is a system. But not very large systems, as it were, have not fully formed and they lack something or are not fully formed, so they are not very interesting to us, and getting out of them is a piece of cake.

I took the term system because it circulates among people, you can often hear phrases about exiting the system among developed people. Therefore, in order not to invent unnecessary terms, I took it, although it can be called something else.

### Social system

This is something that unites all other systems. Different systems merge with each other in a bizarre way, and some form a symbiosis, and in the end, it all becomes some kind of gigantic social system.

We have never known what it means to be outside this system. Everything in it seems natural to us, although it is not actually so.

## Natural system

It differs from all others in that no one created it, accordingly, there are no leaders and favorites of the pendulum.

Exiting this natural system is the most difficult. And it's relatively easy to get out of the rest. The exit goes through awareness. We need to realize the system, realize the manipulations, how it affects us, and after that, we exit.

And to get out of the natural system, you need to prepare seriously. And we exit into some zone of weak attraction. The system will set traps for us, it will want to bring us back. And we need to learn to be completely independent and self-sufficient, to be completely independent of the system, to be essentially equal to the system. That is, you will become the same separate and independent entity as the whole system.

## How to become free

We will talk about all of the above separately, but we will put special emphasis on illusions and prejudices - we need to get rid of absolutely all illusions and prejudices, there is not a single good illusion and prejudice.

We will also study manipulations in order to recognize them, and consequently, to disentangle ourselves from the networks of manipulators and the system. But we remember that we ourselves are not manipulators, the use of these techniques will return us to the system.

We will also need to learn to be completely independent and self-sufficient in all senses, including financially, so as not to depend on the system and not allow it to manipulate us.

And to deal with mental problems and problems of conscience in order to pass the last test when the system exposes all mental problems that it partially hid while we were under its control, and maybe even creates new ones.

In general, it turns out to be some kind of rebirth or transformation from a reasonable person to a free person, and you definitely won't want to return back.
