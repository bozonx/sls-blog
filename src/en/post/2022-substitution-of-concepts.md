Consider the manipulation technique - substitution of concepts. It is very widely used by women, political and social organizations. But despite its prevalence, this manipulation remains unnoticed by most members of society.

The main reason for this is the very destructive impact of manipulators during our lives, who laid down to us the necessary **they** and absolutely **not** necessary **to us** thoughts and picture of the world. And also the fact that most people do not analyze the knowledge and beliefs they already have - everything that has passed into the core of the personality is perceived as their personality and therefore there can be no doubts, otherwise there is a danger to start doubting yourself.

The essence of manipulation is to replace one concept with another than to cause the desired thoughts and actions in the victim. A vivid example: if feminists tell the truth that they fight for the deprivation of men's rights and despise them, few people will support them. Even many women will not want to support them because they love men. But if you switch concepts and keep doing what they do, people react differently and start supporting their crazy ideas. They have substituted man-hating for fighting for women's rights. And oh wonder! They are now supported by almost 100% of women and many men. Now it all looks noble, because if someone is disenfranchised, it's very noble to support those people. But the essence remains the same - feminism is a movement for the disenfranchisement of men. And it's a very interesting thing - men who support feminism are actually supporting a movement against themselves.

## Substitution of concepts that women use in relationships

- The wife substitutes **my** for herself. The needs of the family are actually her needs. For example, **we** need to go to **her** parents, when in fact you don't need to go to **her** parents, but she does.
- Also substitutes your needs for hers. She might say that **you** need to buy a new dress to make **you** proud of what a beautiful wife you have.
- Substituting family needs. When she asks, for example, to buy a car for the family, although her husband has a job 5 minutes away from home and the car will be used mainly by her.
- Substitution of the child's happiness and well-being for her own. Alimony is a prime example. But women manage to pull from the ex-husband in addition to alimony and money for day care, children's clothes, large toys and strollers. Manipulation works perfectly and poor ex-husband does not even realize that he pays a lot of alimony, which the wife spends on herself and therefore she does not have enough money for other needs of the child. Or she just pretends that she doesn't have enough money for the child in order to pull money from the ex-husband
- Substitutes sex and love. Sex is possible only on love, and if without love, it is dirty and disgusting (although in fact it is no different). Thus a woman keeps her husband in the right stream of thoughts and it seems to her that she so prevents his cheating. From the very beginning of the relationship, the woman instills in the man that she is his only opportunity to have sex, all other opportunities - dirty
- The joint budget is her budget. Joint money is your money, her money is hers and is not included in the joint budget
- Hysterical is kind of feminine emotionality and you should appreciate it because she's showing her femininity.

## Manipulation by social and political organizations

- I have already written about feminism, but it is not superfluous to remind that this movement consists entirely of lies, manipulation and aggression towards men.
- LGBT under the rights of genders they slip an absolutely insane culture of abolition, when a person who carelessly speaks out about genders is deprived of all awards, regalia and respect of society.
- Also they (LGBT) call themselves progressive and those who support their ideas, although the word progress does not apply to people just fucking each other. But progress sounds positive and approved, people like progress, so they use the word as a kind of praise for those who support them.
- A man who doesn't want to understand gender is of course homophobic and retarded.
- Russian propaganda substitutes occupation for the word “Liberated”. That is, when they say that the Russian military liberated a city in Ukraine, it does not mean that they left it, but that they kicked the Ukrainians out of their city and occupied it themselves.
- Also Russian propaganda substitutes patriotism for Z-fascism. People who want war and Ukrainian blood are patriots of Russia, and people who oppose the war are traitors.

## A few more examples

- When a man **doesn't** submit to a woman, he's an abuser.
- But a woman has the right to abuse a man during PMS.
- Under the image of a normal, real, good man, women hide the image of a lazy man, not one who takes care of himself and builds his life.
- When a man does something for himself and not for her, he wastes his time.
- If he is into something, such as playing the guitar, then it is a childish ass playing and not worthy of a grown man
- A bachelor means problems with women and there's something wrong with him.
- A man who knows the truth about women is resentful of women.
- A man who knows the truth about feminism is a sexist.
- Your problems are your problems, her problems are your problems.

In general, there are countless manipulations using the technique of substitution of concepts and often they are intertwined with other manipulation techniques, such as sophism and hidden call to action. Why does it work? Because many people accept authoritative and majority opinion without passing through the filter of criticism. But it's not because we are stupid, it's just that we have this peculiarity left over from childhood and no one taught us critical thinking while growing up. And also manipulators strive to create and constantly maintain the illusion of a distorted world, so that the world for the victim is seen as favorable to the manipulator.

I understand that the realization that you have been manipulated all along, especially in a relationship with a woman, can be discouraging. But it's really just the first stage of liberation, you just have to get through it, and after a while the darkness will dissipate. Anyway, you have 2 ways - to go on or forget about everything you have learned and come back. No one has the right to make that choice for you.
