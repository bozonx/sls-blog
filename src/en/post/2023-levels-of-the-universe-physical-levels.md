description: Surprisingly, our everyday ideas about the world are mostly an illusion. Our mind is so caught up in them that it is difficult for it to see even the most obvious things. We strive to free our minds, so we just need to explore the real world. In general, it can be divided into two parts - the subtle worlds and the physical ones.

Earlier, we took a glance at [the model of the Personal Freedom System](2023-introduction-to-the-philosophical-model-of-the-system-of-personal-freedom), and today we'll talk about the levels of the universe according to this model.

## Levels of the Universe

The Personal Freedom System model identifies the following levels of the universe: subtle and physical worlds. Together, they form a single reality, actually what we call reality.

Above our native visible physical world are the subtle worlds: mental, energy-informational, and presumably more subtle worlds.

And below the visible physical world are smaller physical worlds: the atomic level, the quantum level, and presumably even smaller levels.

We will examine each of these levels. In this article, we will go down towards the smallest worlds, and in the subsequent one - up towards the subtle worlds.

## God, spirit, soul

You can find similar divisions of the universe into levels in various philosophical concepts, for example, ancient Greek or Hindu. As a rule, they divide the universe to explain the phenomenon of god, soul, and spirit. But I'm not trying to explain these phenomena; as you can see, there was no place for any of this in my model.

As for the soul, I believe it's a multidimensional concept. What we call the soul is most likely not something specific existing on one particular level of the universe, but a certain commonality of phenomena that our mind perceives as something whole. As for the spirit, it is attributed to higher subtle worlds, and I doubt we have access there.

## About God

When thinking about the universe, of course, the question arises, what about god? Doesn't it bother you that god is said to be one and united, but there are so many religions and gods? At the very least, this should make you think and analyze. In general, I don't believe that even one of those gods exists in the form that most people believe.

Of course, I'm not questioning the existence of historical figures such as Jesus Christ, Buddha, or the prophet Muhammad, and I'm not even diminishing their merits or even supernatural abilities they supposedly possessed. This is not in my area of expertise; let theologians deal with that.

But besides the historical figure itself, there is also an idea that unites everything together: the character, the religion built around him, and the very idea of belief in god. I don't want to upset you, but this is also a system. But I won't directly call for an exit from it; there's no need for that.

I don't want to counteract and criticize world religions, as the modern most massive world religions are not as destructive now as they were before, and in principle, I don't see the point in fighting them.

By the way, atheism is also a system and quite aggressive. You've probably seen adherents of atheism aggressively arguing with believers. Therefore, atheism is also not a way out, because we strive to exit systems, not to transition from one to another.

But what I will definitely call to fight against are cults. They are very destructive, very aggressive, they destroy not only a person's life and future but also consciousness. They totally enslave their victims, leaving them practically no chance to break free, and for the few who manage to escape, it's extremely difficult to adapt to life outside the cult.

## The Universe is a Spectrum

Now let's return to the levels of the universe in our model and look at them as a whole. It immediately catches the eye that there is no main level here, as is often the case in spiritual and philosophical models.

![Spectrum of light](/media/2023-levels-of-the-universe-physical-levels_light.jpg)

I suggest looking at the levels of the universe by analogy with the light spectrum - there is a visible light spectrum, infrared, ultraviolet, and other radiation ranges. Although we see only a small part of the light spectrum, nevertheless other parts of the spectrum also exist, even if they are not native to us. The same goes for the levels of the universe - specifically for humans, the native level is physical, where our body is located, as well as mental - native to our mind, while the rest are secondary for us, although we are represented in many of them.

Subtle and micro worlds are simply parts of the spectrum that are not directly accessible to our senses and mind; they are accessible only with the help of scientific apparatus, if we're talking about physical worlds, and spiritual practices, presumably giving access to subtle worlds.

## Physical Level

![Objects of the Physical world](/media/2023-levels-of-the-universe-physical-levels_phisic.jpg)

Let's now go through the physical levels from top to bottom, starting from the visible physical level.

The visible physical world is the most understandable to us, but far from fully studied - this is the world that we can see with our eyes, hear with our ears, feel with our hands, and smell with our nose. As well as a more global visible world - planets, stars, galaxies, and other cosmic objects that we can see using telescopes. And also the world of microorganisms, accessible to us with microscopes, can also be attributed to the visible physical level.

This level is easiest for us to study, information about it is mostly very reliable, many aspects are well studied by scientists, but much remains a mystery at the moment. In general, you just open Wikipedia, read, follow links, watch videos, read articles, books about space, our planet, animal world, the structure of things, mechanisms, and the like.

Despite the huge abundance of information about the physical world, for many people it is not at all obvious that this world is real, it is the same for everyone, it is not a simulation or a matrix. People from the scientific community, I suppose, are rolling with laughter that I have to explain this. But unfortunately, ideas that the physical world is illusory have become widespread at present. To avoid confusion, I'll say right away that illusions are not at the level of the physical world, but at the level of the mental world; misunderstanding this greatly confuses people.

In fact, that matrix, like in the movie "The Matrix", does not exist. But there is something that resembles it, we'll talk about this in the following articles. But now the main thing to understand is that the physical world in which our body is located is real and the only one for everyone. For now, just accept this fact; in the process, we'll figure out why this is so and where the root of these doubts about the reality of the world lies.

For now, I can say that fuel is added to the fire by a large abundance of various dubious spiritual, esoteric teachings, conspiracy theories, and info-gypsies. After reading and watching low-quality fast-food information on personal development and spiritual growth, many people really think that either a separate world exists for each person, or it's all a simulation. And it's very fashionable now to say that the world is a simulation; surely you've come across such videos in your YouTube recommendations. Well, all this is not true. And the truth is, I'll emphasize once again, that **the physical world is real and it is the same for everyone**.

## Atomic and Quantum Worlds

Below the visible level are the atomic and quantum levels; we'll only touch on them briefly here, as if you're interested, you can simply refer to Wikipedia, where there's a large amount of good and reliable scientific information.

We know about these worlds only from scientific research; we cannot sense them in any way with our senses, but we know for sure that they exist. In these worlds, there are completely different laws, and the smaller the scale, the more surprising and illogical the laws, for example, quantum entanglement simply blows the mind and is absolutely illogical from the point of view of the logic of our physical world.

The atomic world is the world of molecules and atoms that make up all organic and inorganic substances, including us.

The quantum world is the world of elementary particles that make up atoms, weak and strong interactions, and consequently everything else.

At the moment, it is not known if there is anything below the quantum level. So far, these are only theories, for example, [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) states that there are tiny one-dimensional strings that vibrate, and depending on the characteristics of their vibrations, everything that exists at higher levels is created.

But conspiracy theorists claim that there is a giant processor of a supercomputer on which some super-beings launched our world as a game, as we launch games on our computers. Of course, while it's not proven, you can build any theories, but this, in my opinion, is already too much, especially since, as a rule, people who have weak knowledge about the world and science believe this.

Or maybe there's a world of energy and ether there, going deep down, or maybe even closing on the highest subtle worlds. Let this be my personal theory; it seems very tempting and interesting to me. Although at the moment there are no grounds for it, and maybe there never will be.

## Why Study the World?

Surely you've heard the popular saying: "The less you know, the better you sleep". Its essence is to legitimize stupidity and make it more attractive than development and intelligence. In fact, this is said by people deeply mired in the system. They think that a stupid person suffers less than a smart one, that suffering comes from the mind; there's even an expression - "Woe from Wit". This is not true; in the system, everyone suffers, both smart and stupid, but the smart have a chance to get out of the system trap, get rid of suffering, and get a chance for access to happiness. It's not guaranteed, but there is such a chance, while the stupid don't have even the slightest chance for happiness; they just confuse pleasure with happiness.

Also, you've probably heard such folk wisdom: "You can't get all the knowledge anyway". It even seems plausible, but its essence is not to point out the fact that you can't learn all the knowledge on earth, but it kind of slaps the hands of those who strive for knowledge. It kind of sets a false goal - to acquire all the knowledge on earth, and since you can't acquire all the knowledge, there's no point in even starting. In general, the point is for people striving for knowledge to give up. Although in fact, no one sets a goal to memorize all of Wikipedia. So this is not folk wisdom, but rather folk stupidity. Moreover, these are the words of the system; different people pronounce them unconsciously in exactly the same way, not even realizing the meaning of what they said.

And we, free people, need to study the real world because our mind's vision of it is strongly distorted by the system. The distortions can be so strong that right now, in 2023, there are people who believe in the flat earth theory. Moreover, they don't just exist, but there are quite a few of them, and their number is growing. They claim that the earth is actually flat, but scientists somehow conspired to deceive them specifically and hide the truth, imposing on everyone that the earth is round. Moreover, why exactly this is being done is clear only to the conspiracy theorists themselves; the purpose is completely unclear to others. This, by the way, indicates that they are in the game of the system. Just think about it, [centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes) after it was unequivocally proven that the earth is round, right now in **2023, the idea of a flat earth is gaining terrifying popularity**.

This is the most striking example, but there are a huge number of different distortions. Remember the coronavirus pandemic - what conspiracy theories didn't arise there, they even set fire to 5G towers, and all because of ignorance of the real world and a strongly distorted vision of it by the mind at the mental level.

Moreover, studying the real world helps us a lot to develop thinking and expand our mind. We don't necessarily have to study everything deeply, but first of all, at least superficially study those areas where there are distortions. We will talk about this when we study the mental world, which is full of illusions and distortions that keep our mind in a cage.

## Question about the Real World

And finally, I'll ask you one question, the answer to which will be in the next article.

Do you think there exists or has existed in the last 100 years at least one psychic, magician, or person with supernatural abilities? If you know of such, for example, winners of the TV show "Battle of Psychics", write in the comments.
