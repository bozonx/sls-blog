date: 2023-07-21T00:00-03:00
description: The system affects smart people, creating the illusion of loneliness and inclining them to desire status. The system hides the truth about itself. She will attack you through others if you start telling the truth. The system wants to keep you under illusions. Therefore, you can hear the same phrases spoken by different people who are themselves in illusions and spread these ideas to others. And she wants to make us smart people suffer because we are smarter. Ideally, she wants to make us want to be as dumb as the rest of us.

Today we'll talk about some ways the system keeps developed people under control.

## The system affects us through other people

As it exists only in the energy-informational and mental world, it manifests in the physical world through people's actions and words.

Imagine a school of fish - essentially it's a pendulum, an entity from the energy-informational world, if we believe in esoterics. But we only see it while the fish are nearby and form it, that is, it manifests on the physical level through these fish. The same happens with people, pendulums, or rather systems, manifest through the actions of people who are themselves unhappy and make others unhappy.

## Often the system acts through unconscious phrases

- Your relatives somehow constantly criticize what you do, saying: "You'd better find a normal job". They utter these phrases unconsciously, in fact, these people don't really care, they may not even realize that they've said this phrase. If you ask again, the person may not even remember what they just said, as it was a phrase of the system, not theirs. More precisely, not so much the phrase itself, but the manipulative subtext of what was said. In this case, the subtext is: what you do is condemned by society, you should feel the pain of condemnation and outcast, which should push you to choose an occupation acceptable to society, or rather, to the system. Interestingly, the phrases are usually the same - the same phrases are uttered by different people, unconsciously, they may not even fit into the thread of your conversation with this person, they seem to emerge from nowhere and may not be tied to the essence of the conversation. Sometimes it's even scary when the same people say the same phrases, really like zombies
- The same applies to phrases like "when will you get married?", "when will we have grandchildren?" - which your relatives say. Unfortunately, they are completely under the control of the system, they can hurt you with these phrases, harm your mental balance, although they themselves may wish you well
- Also, people from your environment somehow criticize your lifestyle, although there is no need for this, on the contrary, refraining from criticism would help build more trusting relationships. An example from my life - I had a bicycle, and once when I was approaching home on it, my neighbor asked me: "Why do you need a bike? You'd better buy a car". Although I had a car, and I rode a bicycle just for sports and pleasure, and used the car once or twice a week. Obviously, he said this unconsciously, as he himself knew that I had a car, and of the same model as his, only a different color. These were the words of the system, or rather, one of the prepared phrases, apparently, nothing more accurate was found. The purpose of this phrase is to make a person feel uncomfortable - like he's a poor person who can't buy a car, and therefore rides a bicycle. In general, to return a person to the herd of ordinary people, for whom a car has a very high value and status, and a bicycle for an adult man is childish

## The system can also act through attacks

When you're in a group of people where there are women, and you speak the truth about feminism or female parasitism, you'll see how women will immediately start attacking you and try to insult and hurt you, and make your words perceived as the opinion of a fool. There are two benefits to this - firstly, to poke you so that you don't say such things anymore, and secondly, to reduce the value of your words so that other people don't take them seriously, thereby protecting the system.

Moreover, this will all happen in such a way that other men in the same chat or even in the same room as you won't notice the aggression of women towards you, even if you say: "why so much aggression?", men will be puzzled - there seemed to be no aggression. And women will smile, they know everything, and they smile because their aggression hit the target exactly and remained unnoticed, and men behaved as women needed, protecting the idea of female parasitism.

Moreover, men can support women, and you will feel even more oppressed because it will be a betrayal of men - this is a very sweet victory for women defending the system of female parasitism and feminism. Look at their face, you'll see some kind of stupefying bliss on their face, that is, some blissful expression of a person experiencing pleasure, but at the same time some stupid expression, like a person deprived of reason - at this moment she receives a reward from the system in the form of pleasure.

## The system will push you towards desired actions

For example, you will constantly be pushed towards marriage with a woman. This will look desirable and very approved by society, although marriage not only brings no benefit to a man, but is even very destructive. It can completely ruin a man's life. For example, the stories of many homeless people just begin with his wife cheating, depriving him of property, children, taking away his apartment and throwing him out on the street, and now she lives in his apartment, which he inherited from his parents or for which he worked half his life. She lives there with his children, whom he cannot see, and a lover whom she made the father of his children. For them, he is more of a father than the real one.

The system distorts the vision of the mind so much that many men are generally sure that you can't have children without marriage, and if you get divorced, you should go to bailiffs yourself and apply for alimony. It seems funny now, but that's how many men really think.

## The system will dumb you down

If you're a smart, developed, and passionate person, then when communicating with others, you have to talk only on general topics. As soon as you touch on something more complex, people immediately change the topic to what interests them. And they are usually interested in all sorts of nonsense, and they are even ready to listen to you if you talk about all sorts of topics for stupid people. But as soon as you touch on a smart topic, they will immediately interrupt you or may even poke you, make you feel uncomfortable.

## The system makes you suffer

In fact, everyone suffers in the system, both stupid and smart. Moreover, suffering exists only in the system, outside the system there is none. This is a great way to make people susceptible to manipulation and more controllable.

But since developed and more conscious people are more sensitive (which is good, by the way), the suffering for them also becomes more sensitive.

The system creates an illusion of loneliness for smart people, to make it seem like they are outcasts. No one understands them, it's better for them to keep their awareness and development to themselves and not show it. Otherwise, they will be condemned and ridiculed by those around them.

## The system inclines us to desire status

Status is a trap for the stupid, but smart people also fall into it. Status is entirely composed of illusions. And this is not only the status of some high-ranking official, but rather the desire to try on status, like a monkey trying on glasses.

For example:

- Wanting to buy a car or buy a more expensive status car than you have
- Wanting to find a beautiful woman so as not to be ashamed in front of the guys
- Wanting to take a woman to a resort and spend several thousand dollars, although if a man went alone, he would fit into 1 thousand, or maybe less
- Wanting to buy equipment from Apple and other status brands, becoming a slave to the brand
- Wanting to buy an apartment because women won't look at you if you don't have your own housing
- In the case of women, high status for them is to find a man and divorce him for money so that she has status things - the most chic thing is for him to look like a poor person with an old phone, while he bought her a phone of the latest model - for her this means full total control over the man. Also for women, status is marriage, and what is not obvious to everyone - the status of a single mother is very high, for example in Russia. A single mother is very, very statusful and respected in society

In general, for men, it all comes down to the fact that despite the fact that a man gets good money, he is always kept at zero, in order for him to be under control and be a slave to women and the system. Some manage to spend 10 or more thousand dollars a month and not accumulate anything at the same time.

That is, status kind of takes away your excess money and gives you illusions in which you look better in the eyes of other people than you are. The system gives you false goals, your thinking energy is occupied with status issues and buying a more status car. Such a person is very beneficial to the system. He is well-controlled, his personal supervisor or even several in the form of a wife and mistresses receive privileges. And he also spreads the idea of status among other men, boasting and making them envious. And an envious person of course suffers, which is also beneficial to the system. And status pushes women to look for blatant "nice guys" to raise their status at their expense. That is, both men and women get status and it seems that there is a mutually beneficial exchange, but the woman gets real benefits, while the man only gets illusions.

Smart people are also not immune to all this, for example, IT specialists often fall into this pit.

But in fact, happiness is in minimalism and reasonable consumption, moreover, that's where the road to personal capital begins.

## The system also throws traps for the smart

The system throws traps for suffering smart people where they won't feel lonely, will calm down a bit and won't try to get out of the system.

For example, self-development and personal effectiveness. I'll say right away that there are really good things in self-development, but on the surface there's some crap that's basically enough for most people. Also, a false path is excessive enthusiasm for a healthy lifestyle, fitness, spiritual fast food, where people just kind of put on a mask of a spiritually developed person, classify themselves as a caste of enlightened people, but are not such.

Conspiracy theories can be partly attributed to the trap of the smart. "Partly" because not all conspiracy theorists are smart, but smart people also fall into this trap. For example, alternative history or Rodnovers, popularly known as "dolboslavs" - all this is nonsense, but it seems very plausible, and some smart people fall for it even despite their extensive knowledge of history.

And the most dangerous trap is cults. Don't think that cults are for the stupid. There are cults for the smart. For example, I myself almost fell into one of them - the "New Acropolis" cult, which pretended to be philosophy courses.

These were the most characteristic ways of influencing us and controlling us by the system, but there are also many other ways of influence, the meaning of which is not only to make you the same as everyone else, but to make you suffer from being smarter, and ideally even want to be as stupid as the rest.
