title: My story of fighting against the war with Ukraine and escaping from repression
date: 2025-02-24T12:00-03:00
description: 3 years of war, 3 years of Vladimir Putin destroying Russians and Ukrainians, 3 years of Putin replacing the flower of the Russian people with uneducated but loyal migrants, 3 years of Putin squandering people's resources to solve short-term problems to stay on the throne, 3 years of darkness, cruelty, madness and hopelessness. 3 years... Few people thought that this war would last so long. When I left Russia, I was well aware that the outcome of the war, like any other confrontation, is never known in advance, as well as how long the war will last, but even realizing this, I still could not imagine that the war would last so long.

In Russia, I was involved in social and political activities, and was an activist in Alexei Navalny's movement in Vladivostok. I attended rallies, supported various actions from the FBK _(Anti-Corruption Foundation)_, posted leaflets, and moreover, I was a leader who gathered a group of activists with whom we independently conducted actions that we ourselves invented _(by the way, our group was eventually disbanded not by FSB agents, but by feminists because they wanted to impose feminism under the guise of liberalism, but that's not what I'm talking about now)_.

## We were constantly being watched

We were constantly being watched by FSB agents from department "E" _(the department for combating extremism, in reality a repressive body)_ and not just at rallies: when we gathered in cafes to discuss our plans, FSB agents would sit a few tables away from us and film us on their phones; when we filmed political videos in nature, they watched us through binoculars from a hill, they waited for our activists at bus stops and tracked their movements, hacked chats to find out where we were gathering, they waited for us at meeting places and followed us in black SUVs when we organized car rallies in support of Sergei Furgal _(governor of Khabarovsk Territory repressed by Putin)_ and Alexei Navalny _(Vladimir Putin's main political competitor who remained in Russia after Putin killed Boris Nemtsov)_. Just think about it - we only wanted freedom for our people, but we were tracked like dangerous terrorists, and to be honest, even terrorists don't face such persecution as peaceful opposition members. If department "E" really fought extremism rather than the opposition, perhaps the terrorist attack at Crocus City Hall in Moscow might not have happened.

## Many faced repression, but I managed to avoid it for a time

I was careful and tried not to get caught. At rallies, I kept away from the cops who spread out among the crowd. But our younger and more hot-headed comrades unfortunately fell for the provocations of the cops and fell into their clutches _(provocateurs are FSB officers who are sent to opposition rallies and actions)_. Of course, we helped our comrades, supported them in court, raised money for them to pay fines, and helped those detained at police stations. The FSB officers and cops themselves behaved very arrogantly like mafiosi and as if they owned the country, demonstrating to us by their behavior that we were outsiders in this country, they spoke rudely, held protesters in police vans and police departments longer than the allowed time, didn't let detainees use the toilet, didn't provide medical assistance, and there were even cases of violence and shooting protesters with traumatic weapons.

I'm surprised that I never got caught, I was never in a police van or in a detention center. For which malicious tongues accuse me that since I haven't been imprisoned, I'm not a real opposition member, they say if you want freedom - allow yourself to be put in prison, prove that you're a real opposition member _(this is deliberate provocation to make opposition members go for self-sacrifice, which is what V. Putin's regime needs)_.

When the war started, I immediately began attending anti-war rallies, but everything became very tough: anyone who had any identifying marks - yellow-blue or green ribbons, posters and the like were immediately detained indiscriminately. Of course, I knew this and didn't wear any signs to avoid getting caught and generally tried not to fall for provocations, because then I wouldn't be able to continue my fight if I were imprisoned. The FSB officers detained everyone with posters and ribbons and made it so that it wasn't clear that this was an anti-war rally, to make it look like people were just standing in the square. The cops wrote down the details of everyone who was standing there, and I still got caught. The cop who was writing down my information was very happy, it was obvious that he already knew me: he exclaimed "Oh, look who we have here!", most likely I was in their orientation lists, maybe they even gave him a bonus for me.

## Darkness descended, people were repressed and pushed out of their homeland

Despite the fact that I have selective memory and I don't remember many events in my life, although I remember data and the essence of things well, the very beginning of the war is etched in my memory. I woke up on the morning of February 24, 2022, in good spirits in my cozy apartment in my comfortable and wonderful previous life which I had set up well. I picked up my phone, opened a repost of news from a friend, started reading, and then I felt like I had fallen out of reality... I felt like I had fallen into some state of simultaneous shock and numbness, like when you get injured and despite the shock, you don't feel anything for some time. But then comes the realization, and this realization is even more terrifying than the initial shock. The war had begun. War...

It was a collapse. A complete collapse of everything. The collapse of all my dreams, plans, usual way of life - everything was crossed out in an instant. I lived well, didn't suffer from poverty, was planning to move to Kaliningrad because I really liked this city and the Kaliningrad region, had many plans for life and everything seemed clear, in a positive light, and it seemed that everything was within my reach and everything was feasible. But none of my previous plans were destined to come true. All plans and my entire life collapsed in an instant as soon as I received news of Putin's troops attacking Ukraine. I fell into depression, I lay in bed all day with a phone in my hand, not getting up. All I did was read the news for days on end. I only had enough strength to go to anti-war rallies, to the store, and to the psychotherapist.

We communicated in opposition chats with other opposition members, and I was horrified by the level of repression that Vladimir Putin unleashed against the opposition and those who desire peace. It really resembled the worst times in the USSR. Some were fired from work, some were expelled from their studies simply because they don't want war, some were waited for by cops in a car near their entrance for several days and the person couldn't leave their apartment, some were simply intimidated, and one journalist had special forces break in, put his face in a dog bowl and shoved a dumbbell up his ass _(literally)_.

It was impossible to believe! After all, we just wanted peace, we were neither criminals, nor thieves, nor terrorists, we just wanted peace, which is completely normal. What's not normal is actually the opposite - craving for war and blood.

What the FSB officers were doing then was real fascism, and it only increased subsequently. It was a complete takeover of Russia by FSB officers. I'm sure many people in Russia still don't even realize what actually happened then - it was utter hell.

The cops waited for me in the entrance by the garbage chute, neighbors told me they often saw cops. Eventually, they caught me when I was returning from another anti-war rally, they issued me a warning that if they saw me at a rally again, I would face criminal charges for destroying city property and blocking roads _(needless to say, I didn't commit or plan anything like that)_. These cops behaved very arrogantly and impudently, they demonstrated that they had power over me, sneered and behaved like the owners of the country where I was a rightless animal.

After Vladimir Putin passed a repressive law in the State Duma on discrimination against the army, it immediately became clear that we would be imprisoned for 15 years. Detentions under the new article began right away. The FSB officers began mowing down opposition members - imprisoning them, pushing them out of the country, issuing gigantic fines that are impossible to pay _(after all, opposition members are mostly poor intelligentsia)_, taking away businesses and depriving them of the opportunity to earn a living.

Seeing what was happening, I gathered my strength, overcame the depression I had been in for several weeks after the start of the war, and realized that I needed to act urgently. I decided to sell everything and leave Russia as soon as possible, which I did. I urgently sold my apartment, gave away my things to friends, and fled the country from repression.

## I escaped from Mordor!

I was packing so quickly that I didn't even have time to book a hotel in Turkey. I arrived in Turkey with two suitcases of belongings, left the Antalya airport; 6 am; standing on the street without a single thought of what to do next; ATMs don't allow withdrawing money due to sanctions, I only have dollars, standing in a state of stupor. Eventually, I found a taxi driver, he exchanged 100 dollars for me at an unfavorable rate and took me to a hotel on KonyaaltÄ± beach, he arranged with the hotel manager to rent a room for me for 3 days also on unfavorable terms, taking a kickback, but I didn't care anymore, I was confused and was ready to accept any conditions. I entered the room, lay down on the bed and felt such relief as if I had escaped from Mordor. Exactly Mordor! That's what many Russians call what Putin has done to Russia.

I managed to do it after all! I managed to save myself!!! I constantly feared that I wouldn't make it to Moscow, that I would be detained either in Vladivostok or upon arrival in Moscow, or that I wouldn't be allowed to leave the country at border control. But by some miracle, I passed all obstacles and gained freedom. I did it! I escaped from Mordor! It was an incredible relief. I fell asleep in my clothes without even getting up from the bed. And when I woke up, I went outside to explore the new world, the wonderful new world where I am absolutely free! It was just an incredible feeling of freedom that is difficult to express in words. It was freedom! Freedom!!!

## Turkey is a beautiful and fantastic country! A new, albeit temporary, haven

In Turkey, I spent 7 wonderful months, 7 months of happiness. I was absolutely and unconditionally happy literally every day. There wasn't a single day when I felt unhappy or depressed.

In Turkey, I met many cool people. In our first wave of emigration, the cream of society really left: IT specialists, businessmen, crypto enthusiasts, investors, many active and developed men _(specifically men, women went to live parasitically at the expense of men as they lived in Russia, and of course, many feminists left)_.

Greetings to everyone I met then in Turkey and especially to my new friends!

## Betrayal by relatives

I also want to express immense gratitude to my Russian friends _(sending greetings to my friend from Moscow with whom we became even closer communicating remotely than when we lived in Vladivostok and became like-minded on many issues, although our political views differ)_. Not a single friend turned away from me, which I cannot say about my relatives.

Almost all my relatives, who quite recently said that we should meet more often and communicate more, with whom we lived our whole lives, betrayed me. Some called me a traitor, some said that my mother gave birth to me in vain because I'm against Putin, and one even stole my cryptocurrency mining equipment because I don't support the destruction of Russians and Ukrainians, I dare to say something against Putin, and in general, since I won't return to Russia, my equipment can be stolen and nothing will happen to him for it. Other relatives simply demonstratively stopped communicating with me, left the chat and broke ties with me. They all accepted fascism _(Russian fascism is called [Rashism](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC), stemming from the ideas of [Ivan Ilyin](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B8%D0%BD%2C_%D0%98%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD*%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87), V. Putin's favorite philosopher)*, worship Putin and crave the blood of Russians and Ukrainians.

I still can't fully believe and realize the betrayal of relatives! I fought not in words, but in deeds for the freedom of the peoples of Russia and my relatives as well, I admired Russian culture not in words, but attended concerts and theatrical productions, I was a patriot of my homeland.

I went to rallies, fighting for the freedom of my people, despite the danger of repression, and what did they do? Nothing... They not only did nothing for their country but even did the opposite: they opposed those who fought for peace, freedom, and prosperity in Russia.

But it is me who is considered a traitor by people who advocate for the enslavement of the peoples of Russia, the robbery of Russians by Putin and Jewish oligarchs; people who supposedly would tear anyone apart for Russian culture, but have never even been to the theater for performances of plays by Russian authors, people who want grim Putin hopelessness and death in a senseless war for their people. But in their opinion, it is me who is the traitor, not them - as they say, don't get it confused.

## Who is the traitor and who is the hero

Of course, following logic and human morality, the true and only traitors of Russia are Putin, the oligarchs, all his henchmen, lackey cops, FSB officers, Z-fascists, and everyone who supports the war and Putin, including most of my relatives.

But those who oppose the oppressors, without false modesty, are heroes. Yes, we are heroes, if you also sincerely advocated for the freedom of Russia. There's no need to be shy about it. Not those fascist "heroes of the Special Military Operation," but we are heroes! We fought for freedom, therefore we are full-fledged heroes, and of course, Alexei Navalny is the main hero of Russia, who should have monuments erected in Russian squares and streets and cities named after him!

Among my relatives, almost all turned out to be traitors and fascists, but some of them tried to take a neutral position, and not one, NOT ONE supported me. I don't need anything, I have everything, just words of support would have been enough, but instead, I only heard curses behind my back. Curses behind the back of a person who sacrificed his familiar way of life, fought for the freedom of his people, was forced to flee from his homeland from ruthless Putin's repressions. Instead of support, only exclamations of "traitor!" behind my back.

So that you don't think I'm exaggerating the problem of betrayal, in reality, many Russians who want freedom and prosperity for their country have faced betrayal by relatives. In emigration, I've heard many stories, even much sadder than mine. Many people were not only betrayed by their relatives but also reported to the FSB to be repressed, and others were sent to the Special Military Operation _(war with Ukraine)_ to, supposedly, wash away their betrayal with blood. There were cases where even a mother sent her own sons to war into the meat grinder for daring not to love Vladimir Putin and saying something against him.

## Everything here is insane!

Both that Z-fascists don't know they are fascists and consider Ukrainians fascists, and that they are convinced that Ukrainians attacked Russia, despite the fact that the war was on Ukrainian territory. I'll say even more, one of my relatives assured that there are no contradictions in the fact that in [Bucha](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8F_%D0%B2_%D0%91%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5) many civilians were found shot with their hands tied behind their backs, and yet according to Russian propaganda, they killed themselves, while Putin's troops who invaded Bucha had nothing to do with it. No contradictions, everything is logical.

My relatives repeated fascist narratives that Russia has been cleansed of traitors, "get out of Russia, it will be better without you." Is it worth reminding that we are full-fledged citizens of Russia and no one has the right to take away our right to be in our country.

I still can't believe that Z-patriots are happy that Putin is pushing the indigenous population of Russia out of the country, but at the same time they don't object to the fact that instead of the indigenous population, Putin has brought in migrants loyal to him from Africa and some Central Asian countries whom he told that this is now their land and they are full-fledged owners here, giving them Russian passports. And somehow Z-patriots don't feel a twinge of conscience.

Just appreciate the power of Putin's propaganda machine which has achieved that people normally perceive one of the most acute issues for any nation - the territorial issue. After all, no territory = no nation. Without territory, a nation faces the fate of gypsies. Z-patriots don't go to protest actions against pushing the indigenous population out of their ancestral territories and replacing them with those who, by all logic and morality, don't have as many rights to this territory as the indigenous inhabitants.

## Do I regret leaving?

NO. Firmly and clearly. I don't regret leaving one bit, and not for a second did the thought of returning to Putin's Russia appear, or rather to Mordor, to what Vladimir Putin has done to my homeland. There is not the slightest desire to even see my traitorous relatives from afar. They betrayed their people, they betrayed their lineage, they betrayed me, the carrier of their genes, they betrayed their genes. This is the most terrible sin from the point of view of human biology and evolution, they violated kin selection, betrayed their blood relative and their people for the sake of a dictator who has done nothing good for them, who robs and oppresses them, moreover whom they don't even know and have never seen in person or communicated with.

Did I think I left in vain? Of course not! Yes, indeed, Putin's propaganda strenuously pretended that everything was fine, there were no problems, everything even got better, moreover a few months after the start of the war, the ruble even strengthened, this was done deliberately. The narrative was "you fools, why did you leave, everything is fine." But I didn't fall for this trick then and won't in the future. Nothing is fine in Russia. I don't know if they opened a criminal case against me or not, but returning to Russia, knowing that at any moment special forces could break in and shove a dumbbell up my ass, throw me in prison for nothing where they would rape with a mop - this is sheer madness. One of my comrades even jokingly calls this country Shvabrostanm, hinting at what awaits every citizen of this country at a random moment in time regardless of whether they support Putin's regime or not.

We, Russian emigrants, faced a lot of problems and difficulties that we had to overcome. We were kicked out of our homeland, and in Europe, we were given the runaround. In many European countries, they only accepted refugees from Ukraine, but not from Russia. We had to overcome and endure a lot, it was especially difficult for those who moved with families: to get a residence permit, they had to do a mountain of documents, place children in kindergartens and schools, look for work, solve a bunch of household tasks, and all this had to be done urgently and in a country where you not only don't know anyone but don't even know the language. There was a lot of nerves and obstacles, but we survived it all and no one sympathized with us or helped us. People who remained in Russia don't even guess what emigrants went through. And having survived all this, to just take and return to the darkness of Mordor, well no!

Perhaps, if Putin's regime falls, I will come to Russia for tourism and to visit my friends. Russia is a beautiful and gorgeous country, with beautiful nature and beautiful cities where history breathes in every stone of the pavement and brick of historic buildings. But I want to live freely and happily, I am a free person, I am a citizen of the world, I live in a global world, know several languages, and no longer identify myself with any one country.

I hate exclusively Vladimir Putin and his Jewish oligarchs, but not Russia - it's very important to understand this. And while he is in power, I don't have the slightest desire to set foot on the lands of Mordor, I say fuck all this bullshit!

## P.S.

I understand that such stories seem to shift the focus of attention away from the fact that Putin has killed hundreds of thousands of people, that he has broken millions of destinies. I sympathize with the innocently killed people and all who suffered from Vladimir Putin's dictatorship both in Russia and in Ukraine. But such stories are also important. The stories of the repressed remain in the shadow of the tragedy of war. The repressed and we who fled from repression have also become part of history, part of the wave of emigration that will be mentioned in future history textbooks. We are part of the Russian intelligentsia and creative people who create outside of Russia, just like many representatives of the intelligentsia who were expelled from the country by the Soviet authorities in their time - it is these people who in many ways created Russian culture of the 20th century and we are their involuntary heirs. Now we create Russian culture and history, having taken the baton from our predecessors who were pushed out of their homeland.

I want people who managed to avoid the grief of loss and betrayal and who observe all these events from the sidelines to pay attention to our small tragedies, these stories are no less interesting than mainstream ones, they are full of pain, lies, betrayal, and difficult choices, but at the same time, they are instructive and show that not all people are ready to betray for illusory benefits, there are also pure sincere people with a well-tuned moral compass. I believe that you, my dear reader, are such a person.
