Let's first decide if your current place of residence really does not suit you. Make a list of pros and cons and answer the following questions:

- Are there any factors that keep me here: dependents or elderly relatives who need care, children from my ex-wife, valuable friends who will lose touch when I move, a good job. And whether you're willing to give it all up
- Does your locality meet your current and future requirements: can I be realized here as a person, a specialist, a businessman, a creative person, can I launch my project here? Is there good ecology, safety, if there are parks, beaches, do I want to live here for the next 5-10 years?
- Do I get what I need from my city: rich and varied recreation, interesting acquaintances, cultural life, education for children, can I engage in my hobbies fully
- Can I develop here? Are there good courses in English, public speaking, etc., are there seminars in the areas I am interested in, is it easy to find like-minded people here?
- Am I satisfied with the ratio of my income and expenses? Maybe I should change the place of work, activity, move to a place where they pay more or to a place where prices are lower, or maybe I should retrain as a remote employee and go to Bali, Turkey, the Philippines, where the standard of living is good and the cost of living is low.
- Maybe you have to travel far for work or just to take a walk in the park. And when moving, you can choose a convenient place to live where you can give up your personal car. Or on the contrary, move to a village away from the hustle and bustle of the city

Write down all the points under advantages and disadvantages of your current place of residence and give weights to the points, for example, bad ecology can have 3 disadvantages at once, because it has a big weight, and the lack of English courses 1 disadvantage, if it is not very important for you.

Look through the list again, count the total number of minuses and pluses, it is possible that you will be surprised by the results. Maybe you didn't even realize that it's time to leave, or maybe on the contrary you like everything here and there is no need to leave. And only then choose a place of residence that meets your most important requirements. Perhaps it will be another city in your country, or another city in another country.
