Women, especially feminists, love the topic of domestic violence because it's a great opportunity for them to dub all men aggressors and rapists.

Unfortunately, they have succeeded in many ways. Yes, they were not able to push through a law on "family violence" in the State Duma in Russia, which unambiguously defined all men as aggressors and removed all responsibility for domestic violence from women. But they still managed to convince society that women are not guilty by default, and men are aggressors by default. And not only society, but even worse, police officers, judges, bailiffs, guardianship officers, juvenile inspectors - they are all on the side of women. Feminists themselves occupy positions of judges who work with family cases, guardianship representatives and juvenile inspectors. It is also a guarantee that in case of divorce the child will stay with the mother, and only she will decide whether the father can see the child or not. So men's rights are only on paper in the family code, in reality men have almost no rights, only responsibilities (this is in case you did not know).

## So, a lot of men say that women talk down to them when it comes to domestic violence.

There are even instructions in women's publics: how to take away a child from an ex-husband, how to get alimony or how to take away an apartment. Therefore, many women act approximately the same way - call the police, lie to them that her husband beat her and the child, find fighting arseholes among their relatives, by whose hands they will take the child away from his father, as well as set the environment against the husband.

## The women claim that he just hit her and she did nothing wrong.

Let's find out what the reality is:

- Real acts of violence from a man out of the blue are almost non-existent. So when a man hits a woman for no reason, she didn't even provoke him. This happens in marginalized families and then not so often
- In public consciousness provocation is not considered aggression, but response to provocation is considered aggression. Though provocation is exactly aggression and it is after women's provocations that men respond. This response can be considered equal to provocation and its purpose is to **torture** a woman, not just to harm her. This is very important to understand
- Women are the ones who can be aggressive out of the blue, they are the ones who can beat a child or a husband very violently and cause irreparable harm to their health. Otherwise, women's prisons would simply not exist
- A woman will be guilty of violence only if she has caused irreparable harm to her husband or child. If the harm is minor - a psychological trauma or a bruise - she is exempt from any responsibility. What can't be said about men. They will be held liable even for a minor bruise on a woman's body, even if it was not he who left it (in women's blogs, for example, it is recommended to hit the doorjamb and tell the police that it was her husband who hit her).

## Why we should not trust women when it comes to domestic violence:

- Before hitting a man, there is necessarily provocation from the woman, which is nothing but aggression. Which means the woman wanted him to hit her
- If the woman wanted the man to hit her, then we should not interfere in their sexual games at all, if it is just BDSM. It would be very awkward if you got in there.
- Not always, but in general men are used to telling the truth, we were taught this from childhood, not only by parents, but also by the environment. For lying, you could even get beaten up on the street, and even more so, a man loses the respect of his peers if they catch him in a lie.
- A woman, on the contrary, was taught from childhood to lie and pretend, and for lying she did not get beaten and lost respect. Moreover, she has received a lot of evidence that lying works and brings her tangible positive results, at least visible here and now.
- Women often lie about domestic violence. 100% of the cases I know of personally **have been false**.
- Women commit violence more often than men.
- In many Russian families, women are psychologically abusing their husbands and children.

## Should we respond to women lying about domestic violence?

Remember the parable of the shepherd boy who shouted "Wolves! Wolves!", the men would come running and find no wolves, and the boy would burst out laughing. But at one point the wolves did come, but the men no longer reacted. So this is a completely normal reaction of the psyche.

If women are constantly lying about being beaten by men, then we should treat it like in the parable - we should not react to it, because we know it is probably a lie 99% of the time. Yes, maybe 1% of the time it will turn out to be true, but we can't know about it because women lie all the time. So you have to realize that if we reacted incorrectly to the 1% of cases where the man did turn out to be the aggressor, then it's **the women's fault** - they shouldn't have lied all the time! That's a very important conclusion!

## So

- We know for a fact that women almost always lie about domestic violence to make the man look like the aggressor.
- If they're lying, we shouldn't take it seriously - it's just a normal mental reaction. And to take every case of "violence" against a woman seriously is not normal and will not do any good.
- Women almost always provoke a man, which means that women are the aggressors.
- Women often commit violence for which they bear no responsibility at all.
- It is women in families who commit mental violence against all members of the family. And this should be well punished.

## And another very important point

Feminists claim that the only way to solve the issue of domestic violence is to take away the man's apartment or put him in jail. But for some reason they don't talk about anonymous help services for domestic violence, about psychological help groups, about forced psychological help for dysfunctional families - all these things are available in some countries where they really want to solve the issue of domestic violence. But it's as if feminists don't know about it.

Of course, this is just another manipulation - their true goal is not to help people and even more importantly, not to help women in the issue of family violence, but to get a powerful lever of pressure on men, to get men recognized as aggressors by default and to be able to take away their apartments. So I highly recommend you to reconsider your attitude towards feminists, not as women who fight for women's rights, but as sesquists who hate men, despise them and want to enslave them. Feminism is the same as Nazism, only they do not hate a particular nation, but all men as a whole.

## Don't fall for the provocations guys and don't believe the feminists!
