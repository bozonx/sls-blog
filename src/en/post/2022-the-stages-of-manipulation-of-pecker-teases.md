In [previous article](2022-how-to-recognize-a-pecker-tease) we looked at who dynamos are and why we should avoid them as soon as we spot them. Now we'll look at the stages of their manipulation.

## The first stage of manipulation is to create the illusion of increased interest in a man

- She is a little more interested in the man than he is used to, asks questions about his personality and hobbies, which makes any man melt, as we are used to women talking only about themselves and as if trying to build a speech so as not to ask questions to the man and not to show their interest.
- She uses the image of an ideal woman for men. She strives to be similar to men's fantasies - cute, attracted to him, look and behave feminine. And that's why it's very difficult for men to recognize manipulation at an early stage
- She knows that at the first stage she is safe, so she can show more interest, all the same sex will not be. But the main thing is not too much interest, so that the man did not think that she is interested in him and will run after him. She finds some kind of balance
- She tries to cause a man to think - suddenly she is really interested in me, but just hides it and she is really so all feminine - she is what I need. This thought will not allow the man to jump off the manipulation. The dynamist constantly creates confirmations of this thought and tries to keep the man in the flow of thoughts necessary for her
- Some dynamists, on the contrary, show disinterest from the very beginning, which instantly generates the necessary thoughts in the man - I need to do something to make her interested. This is what more experienced dynamos do, they are just too lazy to show interest and play the good girl. They use a tougher technique and go straight to the second stage.

## The second stage is a decline in interest and emotional swinging

On the second date or the 2nd part of the first date if it's been going on too long, she starts to decrease interest, either smoothly or abruptly. She has two goals here

1. To decrease the man's activity to delay sex. Since the man is already warmed up, he begins to act more actively, he believes that enough invested in this "relationship" and there are no obstacles to sex. But of course sex is not part of her plans, so she begins to reduce interest in the man to make sex a carrot that looms in front of him and to use it to lead him in the right direction.
2. To tie a man down with emotional swings. She is interested in him or not. Can during a date suddenly take the phone and start texting with a girlfriend or even a "friend", and then can say, oh sorry I got carried away and continue talking to you, then again in a circle. But most importantly it keeps the man from approaching the moment of sex and keeps him heated. These swings create a strong emotional attachment in the man.

### At this stage, it's noteworthy

- She deliberately prevents the man from progressing in body contact. Of course she knows the sequence perfectly well - first holding hands, then a little hug when, for example, crossing the road, then a hug, then a kiss, then he will touch her genitals and then sex
- To prevent this, she stands in uncomfortable positions for hugging or sits opposite, talks non-stop so that the man could not kiss her, chooses unromantic topics of conversation, can be stuck in the phone and so on - it all looks natural and as if she does nothing so intentional. Of course, the dynamist does all this intentionally, and accidentally something like this can do only a very young and inexperienced woman
- The man has to constantly think how to advance and it all brings him into a kind of stupor and the woman brings him into a semi-trance state, where his desires are strongly heated and his only goal is to overcome all the obstacles that she creates for him intentionally.
- This state is a very clear sign of her manipulative, even hypnotic influence.
- The man has to overcome her barriers because he's been taught to pursue the woman. But only he does not really achieve her, but becomes a puppet in her game, and she creates barriers not to check what a skillful suitor he is, but to divvy him up for money.

## The third stage is dynamo

When a man still overcomes all these barriers and the matter has almost come to sex, she dynamites him - refuses to have sex, in the most cruel variant she does it right in bed. This is incredibly cruel to the man and can even negatively affect his health, will hurt his balls and possibly reduce potency for some time. Of course, she knows exactly what she is doing and what consequences await the man, but she pretends that she knows nothing.

Sex was not part of her plans, but the denial of sex is a great opportunity to shake a man out of a mountain of goodies. When a man is severely screwed up in sex, he has a compulsive desire to get sex at any cost. It begins to seem to him that there is about to be sex, only it is necessary to do something else, he has not done something else or somewhere rushed. Of course it's an illusion, imposed by her. And of course she manipulatively hints at what needs to be done. She may not even say anything, but put the man in such a position that he must think of something, and she will evaluate whether it is good or not. And the man under the fear of losing what has already been achieved, to lose the opportunity to still get sex, when so much has already been done and it seems that there is only a little bit left, trying to find the best way to win her favor, it seems to him that he is on the verge, one wrong move and she will leave him and there will be no sex.

## Note the brazenness with which the dynamite woman does it all

She's not afraid of violence from a man. She knows that the law is on the side of women and if a man shows even a hint of violence, she will call the police and the man will be locked up for "rape" even if he hasn't laid a finger on her. She can also start shouting loudly to call the neighbors, who will also take the woman's side without a trial. And in general, the man is completely under her manipulative control and she has already managed to instill in him the necessary thoughts, so the probability of aggression on the part of the man is minimal.

Of course, she uses the stereotype - "I am a woman, I should not sleep with the first person I meet" and since the man has already laid it down, the man does not show aggression, but acts in the right direction for dynamists - tries to become something more than the first person - to take to restaurants and give gifts, trying to show that she for her nothing is spared.

When a dynamist deliberately reduces interest in a man, he does not understand how it happened that recently she was interested in him, and now one wrong move and she will leave him. This uncertainty introduces a man in the right state in which manipulation is very successful and effortless and well masked. And in the end it will be the man who is to blame, not her, because he did something wrong.
