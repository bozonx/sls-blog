title: Why are men slaves of the system?
date: 2023-08-11T00:00-03:00
description: The system is based on the enslavement of men. She gives them false goals and immerses them in the game of a system full of illusions, where men spin like squirrels in a wheel, but achieve nothing - the eternal groundhog day. Women get more privileges because they play the role of overseers over men, but they still remain slaves to the system. Men's lives in the system are hard, and work is meaningless, so we, free men, have nothing to do there.

Unlike various psychological, philosophical, and esoteric teachings and books that speak about humans in general as if they have no gender, I clearly distinguish between men and women because they have completely different privileges and responsibilities in the system. It is precisely on the enslavement of men that the system and modern society as a whole are based, even in democratic countries, not to mention dictatorships.

Women in the system play the role of personal overseers of men and receive advantages and privileges for this, and their life is easy and relaxed compared to men. But men do not receive any real advantages in the system, they only receive responsibilities, punishment for disobedience, and illusions, just a sea, even an ocean of illusions, created only so that men not only do not try to leave the system, but even take pride in their slave fate and call on other men to do the same.

Accordingly, the life of men in the system is very difficult, both physically, as they work a lot, and morally, as they solve much more complex tasks than women, and carry a huge burden of responsibility for themselves and their family, as well as psychologically, as women create a lot of stress for men and constantly pour their negativity into them like into a garbage bin.

## Everyone is unhappy in the system

In fact, everyone is unhappy in the system, both men and women, but women are quite comfortable in the system and this comfort is more important to them than happiness, let alone some kind of freedom.

But men are especially unhappy in the system, moreover, outside the system they will be much more comfortable and pleasant, and everything they will lose by leaving the system is just illusions.

Personal freedom is so incredible and amazing that no illusory comfort is worth giving up for it, and even more so the heavy burden of men, which they carry all their lives, is completely unnecessary and absolutely useless.

Adult men throughout their lives do not pursue their own goals, but goals imposed on them by the system - they build a house or take out a mortgage for an apartment, maintain their wife's car, provide their wife with excessive resources, work two jobs to appease their wife so that she doesn't leave him and take away the children and everything he owns.

A man works all his life but does not achieve any significant goals - all this and the whole life of many men is Sisyphean labor. And he does this because he is in the game of the system, where **all this seems important, necessary, and has some meaning.**

By the way, note that this position of men and women can be seen in almost all countries of the world, even where there seems to be patriarchy, for example, in Muslim countries such as Turkey - there is, of course, no patriarchy there, it is only nominal.

Real privileges are received almost all over the world only by women, and men provide their privileges, in return receiving only illusions.

## Male slaves build this world

It's important to understand that it is male slaves who build the system and the entire anthropogenic world. Therefore, the system places a huge emphasis on the enslavement of men. However, they build this world unconsciously. Most don't even think about the purpose and meaning of their work, where they spend their entire lives. And they certainly don't bother with philosophical questions about the meaning of life. They consider it unnecessary. They say: "Just go to work, don't do nonsense, don't get into politics, and don't ask unnecessary questions."

And all because in the direction of these reflections lies the exit from the system, which the system protects so that slaves don't accidentally become free. **It is in the direction of the exit that the strongest illusions are found.**

## Male slaves protect the system

Despite the fact that the system gives more advantages to women than to men, it is by the hands of men that the system protects itself, and it uses women to protect the destructive idea underlying the system, through conversations, support of ideas, support of repressions, condemnation of rebels and the like. That is, women in the system are responsible for spreading slave ideas, they create an appropriate atmosphere in which a not very intelligent person easily falls under the influence of the system, just as a fish easily becomes part of a school when approaching it and can no longer break away from it.

Defenders of the political slave system are the dogs of dictatorial regimes, such as in Russia and Belarus, police and special service employees. It is by their hands that the system enslaves the entire population of these countries.

And the defenders of the enslavement of men by women are combat deer, whom women use to achieve their goals, setting them on other men. Also, many liberals, on whom feminists parasitize. By the hands of liberals, feminists fight against opponents of feminism, such as MRAs and all who know the truth about feminism - that it is not a movement for women's rights, but a man-hating movement to deprive men of rights.

Even your environment protects the system. As soon as you want to leave slavery, men with whom you had good relationships will turn away from you, moreover, they will condemn you or oppose you and you will have to taste the bitter taste of betrayal. Although the man who betrayed, of course, will not consider himself a traitor, he will think that something is wrong with you, that you have gone mad or fallen under bad influence and he may even consider you a traitor. And his woman will agree with him and present you in a very bad light in his eyes and convince him that communication with you will only bring problems to the family.

For example, Russian Putin supporters consider traitors those who were forced to flee from repression from Russia. Think about it, it just blows your mind - a person fighting for the freedom of all of Russia and for the end of the war, grinding Russians and the neighboring people, is pursued by special services and he has to leave everything and flee abroad so as not to end up in prison on political charges, but his environment considers him a traitor! Outside the system, this seems like sheer madness, but inside the system, people find it logical and correct.

That is, men are not only slaves and do not fight against their fate, but also protect the system that enslaves both them and everyone else and moreover fight against those who dared to desire freedom.

If you want a smart word - it's homeostasis. The system maintains its stable state by dealing with those who have understood something and does it by the hands of people, primarily close ones, as they are, from the system's point of view, responsible for keeping you in slavery.

Going along the path of freedom, you will see all the disgusting madness of the system, you will be surprised at how insane it is and how insane it makes people under its control.

## Die for the system

The thinking of men in the system is so distorted that in some cases men are even ready to die for the protection of the system and the spread of ideas of slavery and for the enslavement of other men. For example, men who voluntarily mobilized into the Russian army during the war with Ukraine. At the same time, do not think that the system wanted to enslave only the inhabitants of Ukraine, this is undoubtedly so, but the system also enslaved more Russians themselves, the ideas of Putin's fascism were accepted by more than 70% of Russians, although before that Putinism did not have so many supporters.

And again, note that all this is done by the hands of men, and it is men who are limited in rights both in Russia and in Ukraine. And women there and there live quite comfortably, as in a developed state. Although men essentially live under feudalism.

That is, men, being in a disadvantageous position, not only do not want to change anything, but even actively participate in maintaining the homeostasis of this system and filling it with new slaves.

## Few have seen the real world

Going along the path of freedom, you will be surprised at how many illusions are aimed at enslaving men. Many men are so mired in them that they have never seen the real world. Moreover, information from the real world seems to them to be lies and fabrications of mentally ill people.

Again, a vivid example from current reality: it is now 2023, Russians, victims of fascist propaganda, think that fascists are in Ukraine, and in Russia there can be no fascism in principle because it defeated it in 1945. And reality is not just 1% or 10% different from the world of illusions, but 100% - everything is exactly the opposite. Tell a Russian the truth, and he will call you a fool and not understanding anything, or even that the American State Department is paying you, and if you throw a link to Wikipedia, he will say that Americans invented Wikipedia. But the most surprising thing is that these same people, completely absorbed by fascist politics, absolutely sincerely claim that they are not interested in politics ðŸ¤¯.

But in fact, if you understand the logic of the system's game, there is nothing surprising about this.

It is surprising how people can be so unconscious and that they don't even try to understand the life they live, because they only have one life. They not only waste their lives, but also greatly complicate the lives of others or contribute to the enslavement of other people, making them unhappy and condemning them to a worthless existence.

The disappointing truth is that almost all the people around you are completely and entirely enslaved by the system. Therefore, you should not believe what they say without additional verification of information.

## The game of the system

One of the main features of the system is the game of the system. Its meaning is to immerse the victim in a world of illusions and help the system, or rather the pendulum - an entity from the energy-information field, to suck energy from the victim. In this, the game is very similar to the movie "The Matrix", however with a serious difference that the game is only at the mental level, and the physical world remains real and one for all.

The game of the system distorts vision, creates illusions, lowers the value of its victims' goals and exaggerates the significance of the system's goals.

Looking around, you will see a huge number of men who are spinning like a squirrel in a wheel and who do not have a second of free time, and to quickly rest in a very limited time they use doping in the form of alcohol and other substances. They are constantly busy with something, but if you look from the side, they do not achieve anything special. There is a lot of work, but there is no particular result, everything seems to be spinning in a circle, as in a closed cycle. This is the game of the system, and it has only one goal - to keep the victim under its control in order to suck energy from it and for this it gives false goals and incentives and always leads away from the exit from this cyclicity, although the victim may even seem that something is about to change - no, it will not change.

## Typical game

Most men are in a typical game of the system, it has created illusions of surrogate goals for them, such as:

- Buy an apartment and a car to start a family
- Get married to have children
- Work out to find a better woman, and if you add an apartment and a car, he can count on the most aggressive parasites, although of course he will still have to compete with other men to get the best parasite who will drain more resources from him than others
- The false goal of a man is to constantly work at a meaningless job or engage in a meaningless business that does not bring happiness. Moreover, he does not really enjoy the money he earned, all he can think of is to get drunk and have fun with whores. But his wife fully enjoys his money and leads a full carefree life while the man is at work, and it's better if he disappears there for 12 hours a day without days off. And if she has any problems and concerns - her personal slave will immediately solve them. Not infrequently, the wife enjoys such a pleasant and carefree life, which her personal slave provides her, with another man or even several
- The only allowed hobby of many slave men is car maintenance, he is allowed to spend all his free time in the garage to repair the car that his wife mostly drives, who lives a full life and needs a constantly working car for this. And his wife will allow him to buy a car for personal use only if she understands that with this car the man will earn more money for her

Moreover, the slave doesn't even own anything, although it seems to him that he solely owns the woman, owns the house, the car and things and it even seems to him that he has an inalienable right to communicate with children, because he is the father.

But if it comes to divorce, the wife will take everything from him - the house and the car and other property and of course the children, which she will use as a means to achieve her passive income through alimony. She may allow him to see the children only if she understands that the ex-husband remains a good slave and a free nanny, to whom she can dump the children while she has fun with lovers. And of course it will turn out that he never possessed any woman, but she owned him completely and entirely.

And a man, as he had nothing but illusions, so he will have nothing left after the divorce, but he will have the obligation to support an already foreign wife for many, many years.

## A slave has no right to happiness

As you understood, what I described are far from all illusions. The real world, although not as rosy as the illusory one, is real and genuine, and we need to look for the way out into the real world and not be afraid to lose illusions, because it is illusions that make us slaves, and consequently, unhappy.

A slave has no right to happiness. And happiness can be found only by gaining freedom, and **freedom is possible only in the real world**.

## The real world, although not as rosy, is better than the illusory one

Neo from the movie "The Matrix" changed tasty food from the world of illusions for some homogeneous mass that he has to eat to survive in the real world. But he gained a purpose, he found himself, he gained a mission, he gained the real world and it is much, much cooler than the world of illusions, than the matrix.

Although it may seem that living in reality is more difficult than in the game of the system. In fact, this is also an illusion - remember a man working two jobs, not having a second to think - is this a simple life? Yes, if we take a woman, of course the life of women is immeasurably easier, simpler and more pleasant than the life of men, and they do not suffer as much in the game of the system as men do.

But the trick is that we don't need to strive for such an easy and carefree life as women live, as they are also slaves of the system, they just get more privileges from the system for their work as overseers and as if drivers over men, who whip us so that we continue to pull this strap, fill the system with energy, provide privileges for women, involving other men in slavery, adding new slaves to the system.

Therefore, our path lies towards the exit - there we will find freedom and happiness and live the rest of our lives in joy, lightness and enjoying the wonderful real world.

## So why are men slaves of the system?

Men are stronger in spirit, more freedom-loving, they have a sharper and deeper mind, they are better than women at extracting resources, they are able to think about very complex things - about the universe and the world order.

But for the system, the main thing is that the slave does not think about anything like that, but is excellent at extracting resources, being executive, strong, stoically enduring all adversities and not being capricious - for this, men are much better suited than women. And freedom-loving and extraordinary mind must be suppressed, it only interferes with being a slave.
