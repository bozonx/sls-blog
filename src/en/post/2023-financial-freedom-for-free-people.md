title: Financial freedom for free people
date: 2023-09-04T00:00-03:00
description: We are moving towards financial freedom, saving, managing personal capital and setting up a source of income. But at the same time, we do not become slaves to money. Money is our tool for gaining freedom. In fact, it doesn't take much to be happy. You can live happily in warm countries under a palm tree for $350-600 per month. Anyone can earn this money. We manage money in such a way as to make ourselves free and happy, unlike other people to whom no matter how much money we give, they will not be happy anyway.

## Happiness Is Not in Wealth

Financial freedom from the perspective of personal freedom differs greatly from the viewpoint of various financial gurus, coaches, and info-marketers for whom the only purpose in life is personal enrichment. For the sake of this, such people and those who listen to them are ready to engage in any deception, sacrifice personal freedom, and good relationships with people.

Let me say right away that obsession with personal enrichment is the path of a system slave. Even if a slave is wealthy, they still remain a slave to the system and cannot count on freedom and [happiness](2023-what-is-happiness), because these things are achieved through completely different paths.
It is completely wrong to measure people by their level of wealth. A not very wealthy person can be much happier than a rich person. And that's because such a person was walking towards happiness and wasn't a slave to illusions, and for happiness, you don't actually need that much in material terms.

As we discussed earlier, happiness comes with achieving harmony. And concentrating life on wealth, its achievement, protection, and surrendering oneself to the slavery of money and things obviously doesn't lead to harmony, and certainly not to freedom, which means it doesn't lead to happiness.

Freedom is actually the main foundation for growing happiness. And for slaves, happiness is inaccessible in principle, and this does not depend on the slave's level of well-being.

## The Path Becomes Part of You

The concept of the path itself is also important because freedom and happiness are the results of your path that you follow towards these goals. That is, these global life goals are achieved only in the process of the journey; they don't come just like that with a snap of fingers. Happiness won't come instantly if you haven't created a foundation and favorable soil for it.

But walking the path of freedom and happiness, over time you will not only acquire them, but the path itself will become happiness. That is, simply by walking this path, you will already be happy.

Therefore, it's important to understand that you can't quickly jump onto the path of freedom and happiness when you've already become a wealthy slave of the system — you'll have to change a lot and completely revise your life, which not many will do, if only because they won't be able to understand why.

Therefore, it's a bad idea — "First I'll get rich, and then I'll think about happiness." It doesn't work that way. Because these are different paths and you need to walk them for a long time. Each of these paths becomes part of you and your worldview.

## What's Wrong with the Goal of Enrichment?

We make mistakes regarding our life goal by choosing the goal of enrichment instead of the true goal, regardless of whether it will lead to freedom and happiness or not.

We make assumptions that happiness is achievable through crazy enrichment because we experienced positive emotions when we received material goods when we bought something or were given gifts. And at some point, we start believing that acquiring material goods = happiness, without even analyzing these thoughts. Our brain is designed to build cause-and-effect relationships superficially.

The brain builds a simple connection - material goods are pleasant sensations, and pleasant sensations are good, which means we need more material goods, and then there will be more pleasant sensations.

## Empirical Knowledge

This problem is well described in philosophy, called empirical knowledge, which is based on sensory cognition.

In short, for this type of cognition, it's a normal connection that if a rooster crows in the morning, it causes the sun to rise, and therefore if you cut off the rooster's head, the sun won't rise. Obviously, this is a thinking error, and unfortunately, many such errors accumulate in our heads. And the only way to eliminate them is by studying the real world, awareness, and searching for our true goals.

Also, by listening to conversations of other people who are confident in the same things as we are, or rather, they have the same thinking errors as we do, we increasingly unconsciously become convinced of the correctness of these judgments.

And in the end, we go towards alien goals.

This is, by the way, another proof why stupid people can't be happy - simply because they can't understand their true goals and can't doubt the goals that the system imposed on them. And smart people can do this. That's exactly why I claim that happiness is only available to the smart ones, of course, if they make efforts to achieve it.

## Bodily Pleasures

The pleasure of possessing material values is a pleasure of the body level, not the soul. The soul doesn't even know about them. And without harmony with the soul, happiness is not achievable in principle. Therefore, crazy enrichment is not a path to happiness at all, since on this path, harmony of body, mind, and soul is not even assumed.

## The Wealth-Poverty System

From the philosophical model of the Personal Freedom System, there are various systems based on the esoteric concept of [pendulum](2023-the-pendulum-an-entity-from-the-energy-informational-world), also known as egregore. These systems enslave people's minds and place them in the system's game to keep their victims, prevent them from going to a competing system, and solely feed on their energy. And keeping the victim in the system's game happens through illusions. Under the influence of these illusions, some things seem very important to the victim, and others unimportant, regardless of what actually is.

In this case, the main illusion is that material goods can make you happy.

The system overvalues its goals and undervalues the victim's goals. Therefore, those who fall into the "Wealth-poverty" system consider personal freedom and even happiness as something unimportant, but consider material goods very important.

Moreover, this system includes not only rich people but mainly poor people who dream of becoming rich.

And wealthy adherents of this system in Russia are called nouveau riche, that is, the same lowbrows, only become wealthy and not changed their thinking and worldview.

For supporters of this system, the thirst for profit is so great that they will go for any deception for its sake. And by and large, the thinking of slaves of this system is the same regardless of material status.

Therefore, statements that the poor are more noble are false. All the thinking of the poor revolves around material goods, they envy the rich, deceive and fraud even for small money. And they also don't care about building a friendly environment; they can even deceive those who treat them well.

## Incorrect Understanding of Financial Freedom

Regarding finances, many people have a completely wrong understanding of freedom — what they consider financial freedom is essentially slavery in the system, just in a privileged position. That is, for most people, financial freedom is simply big money and the theoretical possibility of not working, though they don't use it. And they don't use it because they initially went on such a path that they won't be able to step away from business. If they stop doing their business, it will simply collapse. And it turns out that people who seemingly have the financial ability to be free, in the end, don't become free and remain slaves to the system until the end of their lives.

And for us, free people, financial freedom is the ability to do what we love, live where we want and where we are comfortable, live and spend our time in a way that keeps us in harmony and makes us happy. We can both work intensively on our favorite projects and not work at all for some time, to come into harmony and give ourselves time for some transition period, sometimes this is needed.

## False Goal

In general, enrichment by any means is a false goal imposed by the system. And if you think about it, there isn't much sense in it. People believe in the truth of this goal, but they've never even thought about whether it's really true.

Mindless enrichment is accompanied by:

- Constant severe stress
- Envy, irritability, and other negative emotions
- High workload
- Rare personal communication not about business matters
- Lack of trusting and friendly connections with people
- High life rhythm conflicting with personal biorhythm
- Detachment from nature
- Greed and avarice that repel people
- Unreasonably high risks
- The desire to squeeze pleasures out of one's body, as higher pleasures have become inaccessible
- And also parasites stick to such people. Usually, it's a woman who fraudulently drains money from a man into her secret account

And many other negative things, and from the positive only material goods, and even that raises big doubts about how much they are needed in large volumes and at such a cost.

If you compare a person obsessed with wealth with one who follows the path of freedom and happiness, everything will be clear as day, who is in a better position and who is in a worse one.

## Their Soul Is in a Cage

The soul of people obsessed with wealth is in a cage of the mind. This means that soul pleasures are inaccessible to them; they don't even have hobbies for the soul, and if they have any hobbies, they see only practical meaning in them. They rarely take interest in high art and the world around them in general. They have a lot of money but don't travel; they can't even allow themselves to simply go to the forest to enjoy a walk without alcohol and barbecue.

## Capitalism, Socialism, and Anarchism

It's logical to assume that capitalism is the cause of enrichment goals. But it's not only capitalism that leads to this. Under socialism in the USSR, it was the same. Only wealth there was obtained through connections with the right people, and theft at production was generally the norm.

Therefore, neither capitalism nor socialism led to happiness, and essentially both had the same system — a system of wealth-poverty, which forced people to compete and think about personal enrichment.

## How Much Money Is Needed for Happiness?

In many countries of the world, you can live trouble-free on an amount from 350 to 600 US dollars per month. Probably the absolute minimum for a more or less comfortable life is probably 300$ per month, depending on the country.

For example, in such countries:

- In Turkey at a resort, you can live from 400$ per month. Moreover, you can live both in an inexpensive hotel with meals and rent an apartment while eating in restaurants
- In Egypt, you can live well for 300$ and more. But this is not a country where you'd want to live long. But wintering there is not bad
- In Asian countries, such as the Philippines, Indian region of Goa, Bali island in Indonesia, Sri Lanka island, you can live quite cheaply
- Montenegro is generally an inexpensive country
- In Latin America, it's also inexpensive

It's important to consider the safety issue, for example, theft exists in many countries of the world, and somewhere even armed robbery is possible. The safest and inexpensive country, in my opinion, is Turkey.

If you have children, you need to add 100$ per month for each child.

You can also pay a local woman, for example, 100$ per month and have sex with her, and she will also clean and cook. You can even have a child with her; it's unlikely they will take it away from you as it usually happens in the post-Soviet space.

## How to Earn This Money

Ideally, of course, it would be good if this money came from investments. But even with hired work, it's not difficult to earn such money.

Many people choose free work, where you don't have to sit in an office 5 days a week and return home exhausted every evening.

For example:

- Seasonal work — at resorts, during sowing and harvesting, work as a snowboard instructor, diving instructor, and similar
- Shift work — work hard for a couple of months and enjoy several months. This includes sailors or those who work on cruises — artists, cooks, etc.
- On-demand work — industrial climbers, divers, and other high-class specialists. Often such specialists travel on business trips to other countries, which can be viewed as free travel
- Self-employment — trading, blogging, and other types of self-employment and small business

In general, there are many options.

Remote work is also a good option — of course, you have to work a lot, but you're not tied to a specific place and can move around the world, become a digital nomad.

But if you have a mission or favorite work, then there's no point in giving up work as a scientist, actor, teacher, doctor, etc. It makes sense to just find better conditions, for example, for a scientist to move to another country where, doing their favorite work, they will have more opportunities both personally and in terms of realizing their mission.

## Personal Capital

But we not only work, we also necessarily save personal capital and learn to manage it from the very beginning, even if it's only 100$. Competent capital management will help multiply it. With the most conservative strategy, you will receive 3.5%-5% per annum in US dollars, and when creating an investment portfolio, you can count on 10-20% per annum.

You can also consider more risky and high-yield options, but they already involve active participation in the process — this is medium-term investing, trading, and working with various crypto assets and financial instruments. Returns will be from 50% per annum. But they require your active participation, which may not combine well with other activities. The principle here is — the more time you spend, the higher percentage you can earn. But don't forget about risks. Also need to consider that, for example, trading is quite a tedious occupation and won't suit everyone.

## Conclusion

As you've noticed, personal and financial freedom is very different from what various financial gurus talk about. If you listen to them, it seems that if a person isn't obsessed with enrichment, they're a loser. And achievement has generally become some kind of cult.

Some people, after listening to such poor coaches, abandon their favorite work for the sake of profit, and the result of this is more than predictable - they lose happiness and their life becomes poor and incomplete, even despite the fact that they have good money and material goods.

And if a person has completely abandoned their mission - this is simply spitting in the face of the universe. And let them no longer wait for its grace.

Don't let yourself be carried away by the idea of personal enrichment. Our goal is freedom. And the idea of crazy wealth is actually false, it's a trap, it's one of the systems that will place you in its game full of illusions.

To grab as much money as possible and spend life protecting and servicing these riches – definitely this is not the path of freedom and not even the path of happiness.

And often such wealth brings many negative consequences and almost guarantees deprivation of warm friendly communication.

And in fact, material goods cannot be a source of happiness because they are connected with the pleasure of the body, not the soul. And as we found out earlier, it is the soul that gives us happiness.

But let's not forget that we don't reject money. We certainly need them, we need personal capital and a good source of income, we study the stock market and cryptocurrencies. But we are not slaves to money, we use them, not they use us.

People obsessed with enrichment measure people by their income level. But a free person even with a small income will be in a much better position than a rich slave.

Such people accordingly won't come here. But you and I are completely different, we know the great value of freedom, we have inhaled its sweet air and will never exchange it for anything else again.
