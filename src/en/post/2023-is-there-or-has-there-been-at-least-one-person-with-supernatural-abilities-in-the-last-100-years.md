Here's some information from the real world that I think will surprise you. We open the page [list of prizes for demonstrating the supernatural](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%B7%D0%B0_%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8E_%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%85%D1%8A%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE) on Wikipedia and see a large number of prizes starting from 1922. That is, the first such prize appeared 101 years ago. In this table, there are as many as 28 prizes, many of them with quite impressive prize funds, there's even a Russian Harry Houdini Prize, in a country where a TV show called "Battle of the Psychics" is very popular, which speaks for itself.

So, none of these prizes have been claimed in 101 years. Think about it again, there hasn't been a single laureate of any of the 28 prizes for demonstrating the supernatural! And not because no one came for them, on the contrary, many people came, all of them were absolutely sure of their supernatural abilities. But every single one of them turned out to be a charlatan, just like the winners of the TV show "Battle of the Psychics", of which Russia has had no less than 23 seasons, that is, there were 23 winners recognized as psychics. Of course, none of them possess any supernatural abilities, like no one else among the living people on earth. And even some witch granny from a remote village, whom someone has surely told you about, whom people visit to get her to cure them of alcoholism and other ailments, is nothing more than just a person with an inflated sense of self-importance.

Just think about how much objective reality differs from what most people think about it. Surely many people you know, or even you yourself, thought that at least one psychic exists, at least one of the 23 damn winners of the TV show "Battle of the Psychics" has at least some abilities. But no.

This shows how strong illusions distort the vision of our mind, so strong that we can be not 1%, not 10% wrong about the real world, but 100% mistaken. And believe me, there are many, many such illusions, and not all of them are as harmless as the illusion of the existence of psychics, and not about all of them can one so easily find truthful information.

You have no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes, how distorted the perception of the real world is for most people. The opinion of many people is so far from reality that it seems they live in some other fairy-tale world where magicians, psychics, shamans, and other fairy-tale creatures exist.

These illusions are a feature of the system, it's the game of the system. The system keeps us under its control, keeping us enslaved by illusions.

It may seem strange that I write articles about esotericism but don't believe in psychics. I want to show that there are still things that are difficult for our mind to access, which philosophers around the world have been struggling with for millennia. But this doesn't mean that we accept any nonsense on faith. And we also need to learn to independently study the real world, find reliable sources of information, and always analyze the information received and thoroughly verify it. Without possessing information about the real world, it's impossible to gain freedom.
