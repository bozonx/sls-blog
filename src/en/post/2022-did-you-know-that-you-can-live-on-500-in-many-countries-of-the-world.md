Now, due to the situation in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, many people are considering moving.

The most popular destinations are Turkey, Georgia, Bali, the Philippines, Goa, Cyprus and Montenegro. Of course, at the height of the tourist season prices are inflated, but the season will soon be over. So in all of the above countries you can live alone on $ 500 and:

- Eat great food, eat fresh fruit every day
- Live in a hotel where you don't have to clean. Or in an apartment where the cleaning lady will clean.
- No need to cook - you can live in All inclusive hotels for pennies or eat cheaply in cafes and restaurants.
- Every day to swim in the warm sea, walk and enjoy the cool weather.
- Travel on weekends and not only, even move from country to country.

And for all this you only need $500 a month. Many modern remote professions can give such an income and not only in the IT industry.

## So how can you earn this $500?

The most obvious is to learn the IT profession and get a job as a junior (junior developer) in an IT company as a remote worker. IT employees are now very much in demand, so many IT companies are ready to train you, only for this you need to have already the initial knowledge, which can be learned on the Internet or at the appropriate courses. Directions: python programmer, frontend programmer on React or Vue.js, system administrator, database administrator, data analyst, devops, tester, specialist in artificial intelligence, etc. In general, there are a lot of interesting and in-demand areas.

### Not only IT specialists can work remotely. You can also:

- Become an assistant blogger or even start your own blog. This is a great opportunity to earn remotely. Perhaps an assistant blogger will have less income than programmers, but you need to study less.
- SMM specialist. Good earnings and training is easier than that of programmers and system administrators.
- Video editing and photo processing. Work monotonous, but those who are not afraid of it is a great opportunity to earn good money remotely
- Sales managers, working with clients, client base, etc.
- Rent your apartment in your hometown
- If you know a foreign language, you can translate texts or teach the language through Zoom
- The same applies to fitness, psychology, nutrition, etc., which can be taught remotely
- For those who do not want to study for a long time and are not afraid of monotonous work and want to immediately get good money will suit the profession of mobile application tester. You don't even need to write selenium tests - usually you just need to poke at the application and find bugs.
- Become a trader
- Accumulate capital and live on dividends
