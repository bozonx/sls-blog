## What is manipulation anyway?

It is the covert influence on a person in order to make him/her act in the way desired by the manipulator.

## Let's take a closer look

- Manipulation is characterized by regularity. The manipulator trains the victim's psyche, forcing the victim to act in the desired manner
- The manipulator keeps the victim in a constantly irritated state, because in this state the victim is most easily manipulated.
- He finds a way to keep the victim in this state by testing and analyzing the victim's reactions. He regularly checks whether the victim is under control: he asks the victim to do something or says phrases that cause the victim to react in the desired way
- Utilizes the victim's decency, kindness, high moral principles and unresponsiveness.
- Manipulation is hidden to outsiders. If you complain that you are manipulated by someone, the other person will not even notice it and will be perplexed and may even say that you are making it up. The most surprising thing is that people do not notice the hidden subtext in the communication between the manipulator and the victim, even if they heard the whole dialog or read everything in the general chat room
- The manipulator ridicules the victim's attempt to reveal the manipulation and makes the victim look like a fool and an idiot. Thus, he hides his true intentions and sows fear in the victim so that he will not try to do so again.
- The manipulator himself is infantile, he learned to manipulate as a child by his parents and developed this quality throughout his life.
- Without the ability to manipulate, he is worthless, not self-sufficient, useless, feels lonely, he is a gray and empty personality
- The manipulator develops the victim's fear of rejection. When rejected, the manipulator may jab and humiliate

In general manipulation is aggressive behavior and does not bring anything good to the victim. That's right: MANIPULATION IS AGGRESSION! I think you have already drawn parallels with the behavior of your current or former woman. Yes, women are very skillful manipulators, they use a lot of manipulative techniques. But men are also manipulators, although much less often than women, the arsenal of manipulation in men is not so extensive.

## Consequences for the victim

- Frequent irritability and stress. The victim is in a constant state of irritation.
- Depressed, depressed and depressive.
- The manipulator alters the victim's lifeline in a way that is not good for the victim.
- The victim is less engaged in his/her tasks and does not develop.
- Decline of strength. There is only enough strength for the most basic tasks
- Low self-esteem, self-worth, and self-love.
- The victim has a kind of blurred consciousness, it is difficult for her to see the manipulation itself. The victim does not realize that he or she owes nothing to the manipulator.
