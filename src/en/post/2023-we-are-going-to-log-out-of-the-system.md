title: We are going to log out of the system
date: 2023-08-19T00:00-03:00
description: The way to log out is not easy, being in the system it is not visible even if you are standing a step away from it, you are groping your way like a blind kitten. But the result is definitely worth it. Having tasted the sweet taste of freedom, you will not exchange it for anything else, your soul will no longer want to be imprisoned in the cage of the mind. This is a completely different life, which still needs to be learned in order not to fall back into the trap of the system.

Today we will head in a forbidden direction, towards the exit from the system, but I warn you right away that information about exiting the system may have consequences that are considered destructive within the system, although in reality they are very positive and desirable for us, free people.

## Is this the Matrix?

Being in the system, we are like blind kittens, we can't see the exit even when standing right in front of it at arm's length. This is because our mind's vision is greatly distorted by the illusions that the system envelops us with. These illusions are part of the system's game, what other authors call the Matrix, by analogy with the movie "The Matrix".

But I call it specifically the system's game, because it's like a computer game where the character is placed in certain circumstances, given goals, and can't go off-goal, and if he does, he'll end up in an unprocessed space - beyond the map, "out of bounds", where the player usually gains the ability to fly around obstacles and see everything from the side (in our case we won't fly of course, but many obstacles will simply disappear and we will definitely see the world from the side).

## Let's try to feel for the exit

Like the matrix, the system's game also has an exit, which is very different from exiting the matrix, but in any case, it's an exit to the real world.

The exit is in the direction of thought that is not customary to think about while in the system. Moreover, discussing these thoughts with other people will cause unpleasant sensations. This is how the system protected itself so that its slaves wouldn't accidentally leave.

Therefore, exiting the system is partly associated with unpleasant emotions - but don't be upset, they are nothing more than illusions and don't mean anything in reality. The system exaggerates the significance of these unpleasant emotions for us and diminishes the significance of freedom.

The exit is in the direction of reflections:

- About the meaning of life
- About your role and place in life. Why are you living at all?
- What's the point of your job, where you spend your whole life?
- Are you living the life you should? Is this the adult life you dreamed of as a child?
- Life in the style of work-home until retirement, and barely making ends meet in retirement? Is this your choice?
- Is there room for creativity in your life?
- Is there room for philosophy, reflections on the universe, and understanding the world in your life? Or do you think you've already understood life without this?
- What if you have a great mission, but instead of this you're drinking, constantly looking for sex, and doing the wrong things?
- Reasoning in the direction of money: how much do you really need for happiness? And is your goal to be their slave?
- Reasoning about relationships with women: do you want to devote your life to ensuring their privileges, while not having even basic rights yourself? Do you want to be a woman's slave all your life, giving her everything down to the last penny, and in return receiving only illusions?
- And sex? Is it really worth becoming its slave and the slave of a woman?
- Do you know the truth about feminism? After all, it's supported by almost all women and many men. It's the largest ideology at the moment, even larger than political and religious systems. Is it really a movement for women's rights? Or something else?
- And if you're Russian, you should definitely think about your state - do you know the truth about it, about the president, about the elites, and especially about the war? No more than 15% of Russians know the truth, for the rest it's under seven seals. Propaganda has created a whole fictional world for Russians, so they are, as it were, in a double system - in a system within a system. Accordingly, the exit is twice as difficult, but it's definitely worth it

Well, in general, you get the direction - what is not customary to think about. And a person thinking about all this will be called a fool, ridiculed, humiliated, and repressed.

## You can't change the system by 1 or 10%

As you reflect, you will see that you can't change something by 1% or 10% and leave it as it is - this won't change anything, because the system has no goal of making its slaves happy and free. The system is 100% false and destructive.

## Whirlwind of illusions

So that we don't accidentally find the exit, the system has strengthened illusions precisely in the direction of the exit. If you accidentally and unconsciously wander into forbidden territory, the system uses a simple slippery slope manipulation, distorting your perception of reality so that you slide back into the stall. Soft manipulation is needed here so that the system doesn't reveal itself.

But if your movement is conscious and directed towards the exit, the system sounds the alarm, it raises all forces to hold you - there's no time for conspiracy there. It's then that you will see the system for the first time, all its disgusting and insane essence.

## Mr. Smith

If you're heading for the exit, the system first connects your loved ones, who are responsible for keeping you in the system. This is similar to the movie "The Matrix", where Mr. Smith inhabited people and opposed Neo with their hands. So your loved ones will say unconscious phrases that should sting and stop you, but they themselves will not be aware of this and may not even remember what they just said if you ask again.

## If you get scared and retreat, the system will erase your memory

If you didn't cope with emotions, got scared, panicked, fell into anxiety, alcohol, stepped into one of the traps that the system set for you, or thought: "To hell with it, why do I need this, it was normal and comfortable, why change anything", then you immediately return to the system under its control.

That is, there is no red pill like in the Matrix movie. To stay out of the system, you will first need to make an effort to learn how to live outside the system and not let it pull you back in. But then this will simply transition to automatic mode like any other skill.

If the system pulls you back in, everything becomes the same as it was before, as if nothing had changed, as if close people didn't aggress against you, as if they didn't betray, they all communicate with you as if nothing had happened. And most importantly, you quickly forget that you were a millimeter away from the exit.

But you won't notice these changes anymore, because the system will erase your memory. It may even reward you with calmness and pleasant sensations to fix in your memory that it's better in the system, and there's only discomfort at the exit. But these pleasant sensations won't last long, and soon you'll return to your wheel, which you'll spin like a squirrel all your life, like all other people you know, and you'll forget that you were so close to the exit.

## Accidentally fell out of the system

Even if you accidentally looked beyond the edge of the system, and this happens in rare cases, for example, during severe depression, spiritual practices, a random encounter with a free person, or accidentally leaked information from beyond the system, the system will still erase your memory and make you think: that this is madness, it's not normal, it's better not to think about it, it's better to return to your stall.

But interestingly, the accidentally seen reality remains in memory, albeit weakly remembered. It's like when you wake up in the morning and almost the entire dream is forgotten, but you remember that there was something incredible there.

## Each attempt reduces the probability of success of the next

Just as each attempt to quit smoking reduces the probability of success of the subsequent attempt, and after several attempts, a person resigns to their fate and already buys cigarettes not by pack but by blocks, to exclude cases of accidental lack of cigarettes.

When quitting smoking, you can be helped, for example, by a psychotherapist. But when exiting the system, no one can help you. There is no such specialist whom you can simply pay and he will make you free. You're walking on an untrodden path, there are only a few like you. Information needs to be collected independently bit by bit.

Therefore, before exiting, you need to prepare well to increase the probability of success and reduce negative impact.

## How difficult is it?

On the one hand, it's not easy, because we're so deeply mired in illusions that we need to learn to live without illusions and without the system anew, like a baby learning to walk.

But on the other hand, all the difficulties are mainly associated with illusions, which means that the difficulties themselves are essentially illusory.

For example, when you find out that some people from your environment are not even worth congratulating on their birthday. It's good that you found this out, even if it's not pleasant, otherwise you would have lived thinking that this person is important to you and would have built relationships with them, invested in it.

The same applies to money - living financially independently is more difficult, you need to study the topic of finance and cryptocurrencies, experiment and sometimes take risks. And it seems that just working for the uncle, without raising your head, is easier, calmer and less hassle.

But in fact, working for the uncle is even a greater risk. And the stability that such work gives is illusory. Imagine that something happens to the unfortunate worker, for example depression or burnout, not to mention disability received at work. He will become unnecessary and all his stability will collapse. And look at pensioners in Russia, they worked all their lives for what? To fight for expired products in retirement?

As soon as the worker stops working, his life turns into hell. This means that the risks in the lifestyle of a system cog are even higher than those of a financially free person.

## What we will get

The most important thing is that, despite all the difficulties, what we get is incommensurable with what we lose. Absolutely everything that is valuable in the system actually has no value.

Freedom can be described specifically - financial freedom, freedom of movement, freedom to choose your destiny, independence from society, from women, from the state, freedom of creativity, search for yourself, your mission, etc.

But the most important thing is not even this. The most important thing is freedom itself, it's difficult to describe in a way that would be understandable to a person in the system. A slave cannot understand what freedom is, it's not important to him, he won't even give up the most useless illusions for it. But you and I are completely different, we are free people, and we know where we need to go.

And also, having gained freedom, we free the soul from the cage of the mind, which means we get the right to happiness.

## Out of bounds

Once out, you will become one of us. You will be reborn, enjoy it, feel this amazing feeling with every cell of your body. Mark this as your new birthday.

You will notice that this feeling of freedom, lightness and joy lasts for a long time, like no other positive feeling you experienced earlier, being in the system. In the system, joy was short-lived. **Now happiness is with you forever**, it can become the background of your life, just don't spoil it.

At first you will have to get used to it. At the beginning outside the system, it will be unusual, you will be among people, but there will be a feeling that you are as if on different planets, even though you are nearby.

You kind of fell out into out of bounds, like in a computer game, although of course you can't fly like there. In general, you became like an observer. You kind of hacked the system, and it stopped reacting to you, like mobs stop reacting to a player in out of bounds. Surprisingly, you will even be able to consciously influence the system a little.

## They are among us

There are not many free people, they are among us. But you won't recognize them while in the system, you can talk to them without even knowing they are free. A free person can be felt by people with more developed sensitivity, it will be a person as if from another world, and there will be some weak incomprehensible and constantly elusive feeling - he exudes freedom.

He may return to the system a little, and in order not to cause a reaction to him in the system, he learned to be nobody and nothing, such people are not visible, they seem to become transparent. Nothing in this person irritates you, he is smooth, there is nothing to cling to. Talking to him, you won't notice how the system smoothly takes you away from him, he slips out of your field of vision, like soap from your hands, not because he wants it, but because you are on different sides of the system.

## Your personal path

Remember that freedom is your personal path, you can't take anyone with you. You will go on this path absolutely alone, but don't be afraid of this, you will understand later how cool it is.

Yes, you can share this information with a friend, and maybe he will also go on this path, but don't count on him reaching the end and that your paths won't diverge. There is a high probability that one of you will turn off the common path.

You can't take responsibility for someone and drag them along the path of freedom. **Freedom is what you take yourself**, what you persistently went towards, and what you deserve - Freedom is your reward for everything you've been through, for all your suffering in the system, for the risks you took heading towards the exit.

Therefore, think before sharing this information with other people, share only with worthy ones, this is your gift to a worthy person.
