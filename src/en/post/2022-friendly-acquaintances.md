You can find a lot of information online on pickup and less on networking. But I want to introduce you to a slightly different type of dating, which is part of the Personal Freedom System's free man concept.

## Let's take a look at the differences in the goals of dating

- Pickup - meeting women for the purpose of getting sex or creating a loving relationship.
- Networking - getting to know people (men and women) for the purpose of using them or having a mutually beneficial partnership. That is, the goal is to benefit from the acquaintance
- Friendly dating - getting to know other men for a high, interesting communication, joint hobbies, trips, having a great time. Or participation or organization of some projects

## Why a free man doesn't need to develop pickup skills

Because the time and effort spent on learning pickup is not comparable to the small result that you get. You can get sex with much less effort and you don't need to read books or videos on pickup and go to expensive courses.

#### What's wrong with networking?

Networking is primarily used in a business environment where utilizing people and mutually beneficial partnerships is the norm and perhaps a necessity. In normal life, it's toxic behavior. People don't like to be used. So what if the success of your business is not about networking, there is no need to learn networking.

## What the Personal Freedom System offers

- Dating for the purpose of friendship. You don't necessarily get deep friendships, buddy relationships are fine too. Most dating will be for a period of time, not for life - nothing wrong with that, accept it and enjoy it
- Dating and creating localized communities with men only. Women should not have equal rights in them. Not because we are sexist, but because they will destroy that community or use it to push feminist ideas and ideas of female parasitism. I have unfortunately encountered this more than once. Likewise, women are always looking to use men - we don't need that
- We don't need to use members of a friendly community to benefit from them. We are self-sufficient and independent people, we can solve our own problems. We socialize for the buzz, but if someone can help you with something or give you a hint it would be great. It happens a lot, but we don't make that our goal
- We meet, chat, go to cafes, movies, theaters, to the sea, ride bikes, motorcycles, travel and so on. In general, all that you can freely do alone, but more fun and interesting to do with friends or buddies
- Mutual aid, of course. But we **don't demand** that.
- We participate in or create community or business projects together - it's fun and interesting and useful for everyone.

The important point is that all community members (even if there are 2 people in the community) share in the benefits of being in the community and everyone is self-sufficient. It should not be that individual community members are focused on getting more benefits than others.

## There are a few things to understand

- Don't aim to use your friends and buddies. Be self-reliant and at the same time share your experience and knowledge and help others and you will be helped as well
- And of course do not let yourself be used. In this case, a person communicates with you not because you are an interesting person and a good friend, but because he benefits from communicating with you.
- Get rid of the pseudo homo-taboo - if two men sit in a cafe or go to the cinema, they are not homosexual. Homophobia is complete nonsense! It is perfectly normal to invite a friend to sit in a cafe to chat, drink coffee and cake, not alcohol
- No need for feigned interest. If you are not interested in a topic, then do not ask leading questions just to show that you are interested, as Dale Carnegie taught. Rather, find a common topic of interest to you
- You will have to overcome your fear of approach and approach and start a conversation yourself. The likelihood that someone will approach you is low, unfortunately, other people are just as shy. Remember that it's perfectly normal to get to know and start a conversation with a stranger, as children we did it with ease
- Yes, there will be rejections and awkward moments, you can't do without it. But you will grow quickly on this, refusals have many benefits for personal growth. But you will definitely get to meet someone interesting and have a great time.
- The easiest, most natural, socially acceptable and effective way to meet people is contextual. You go to a themed event - a motorcycle/bike festival, a gathering of drone enthusiasts, photographers, etc., of course, if you are passionate about it yourself. And start communicating just about what you see - ask what kind of drone is it, I haven't seen such; what year is the bike; I saw such a bike on Avito, how is it in general? And so on. Just don't ask stupid things like - aren't you afraid that you will crash on a motorcycle or how many speeds on a bicycle?
- Be good-natured, friendly, responsive, seek to help and advise. This is great for the introduction phase and takes away the awkwardness. Imagine how strange it would be if a person came to you to get acquainted and was not friendly
- Communicating with a person who is good-natured is already great and can be the goal of getting to know them and meeting them regularly.

## Lastly, let me tell you about one of my dating experiences.

At one time I was into mountain biking. At the beginning and at the end of the season in my city, where I lived, held bike rallies - blocked part of the road and cyclists amateurs, pros and in general all in a row rode through the city. In general, at the opening of the cycling season I arrived early on my bike and since nothing was happening, everyone just stood and waited for the beginning, I decided to get acquainted with someone.

I went up to one guy and started chatting. I see his eyes roll back, he looks scared. That he did not expect and was not ready for the fact that some man will come up and want to talk to him, or assumed that I have impure sexual plans for him))))))

Anyway, I finished talking to him and walked away. I thought: okay, it happens. Then I approached another dude and we chatted, it turned out that he was also from the IT industry. We did a bike ride and then we rode the season together and went to the mountains.

The moral is that if I had not met anyone then or had closed on an unsuccessful acquaintance, I would not have met the dude with whom we cool then rode bikes and hiked in the mountains - I just would not have had these impressions and the pleasure of communication.
