Not poor means that you have free money, manage your expenses wisely and have a good source of income or even several. All this makes you feel independent, not stressed about money and makes you feel freer and happier. This is what personal finance management is all about, not becoming a slave to money in blind pursuit of it.

## Basic Principles

- expenses should always be less than income.
- invest the remaining delta in your capital according to your financial plan.
- manage and maximize your capital.
- of course have a financial plan and budget for the next month. Imagine that you are a company, you can not not keep accounting and do not have a financial plan, otherwise such a company will quickly go bankrupt. The same should be done with personal finances: keep a record of expenses, plan a budget, have a financial cushion
- Be sure to control your expenses, write down everything by category
- exclude parasitic expenses, such as spending on women and drinking
- exclude or reduce the amount and number of subscriptions to games, apps, utilities, avoid commissions.
- your income should increase by at least 20% per year - think about how to do it.
- Study the stock market, different financial instruments and ways to get "passive" income.
