Women love to repeat this attitude, but what's wrong with this statement? Let's get to the bottom of it:

1. A call to action with the word "remember", which implies that the following phrase is something very important that does not require doubt and discussion
2. the unquestioning style of the entire phrase, implying that it is not subject to criticism.
3. "At 70, your wife will serve you a mug of tea" - where is the guarantee that you or your wife will live to be 70 and your wife will be in good health? Where's the guarantee that she won't leave you? Where is the guarantee that she will even want to help you? Of course there are no guarantees, but the statement is full of confidence that you will have a wife and will help you at age 70
4. Wife is contrasted with friends. That is, it is assumed that you have already accepted the fact that there is a choice: either a wife or friends. Although in fact they are different things and one does not interfere with the other. And it is more common to find a man's friendship until deep old age than a woman's love
5. It is claimed that the only way to get help in old age is to have a wife. Although that's not true, of course. How about living somewhere in Portugal in his villa and have a nurse who will provide you with professional care, which no wife not only can not be realized at a high level, but also does not want. You can also live in a private nursing home in your old age
6. The message is obviously for men, but not for women. Women in relationships are known to be the ones who tend to alienate a man from his friends. The purpose of this whole phrase is to prepare the ground in a man so that he acts and thinks in a way that is right for women

So, what this phrase is: a rather aggressive manipulation, which prepares the ground for manipulation of a man and adds mass to such statements so that when the critical mass is reached, they can pass through the filter of the personality core and take root in it as part of the personality.

What should be done when you see such a phrase:

- immediately pay attention to the unappealing style, it should be repulsive.
- recognize what the phrase is really about.
- talk inside yourself about what the situation really is and what is wrong with the statement of this phrase and what positive statements are true.

All this will not allow negative statements to pass the filter of the core personality, moreover on the contrary you will receive confirmations of positive statements.
