title: Subtle worlds based on the model of the System of Personal Freedom
date: 2023-08-08T00:00-03:00
description: We are multidimensional beings, represented at all levels of the universe at the same time. The physical and mental levels are clear to us, but there is also an energy-informational level, as well as levels above. To understand ourselves and the world as a whole, we need to understand, in addition to the familiar physical world, more subtle worlds, as well as phenomena such as pendulums, the law of synergy and what the soul is.

Here's the translation of the text from Russian to English, maintaining the Markdown formatting:

Earlier, we began to consider the philosophical model of the Personal Freedom System, in which we became acquainted with [the levels of the universe and examined the physical world](2023-levels-of-the-universe-physical-levels).

Now let's look at the subtle worlds. They consist of:

- Mental level
- Energy-informational level
- Presumably, even more subtle levels

The most interesting and non-obvious for many is that the subtle worlds are quite real and form part of the spectrum of the universe in which we and everything that exists in the universe are located. Of course, this is only from a philosophical and esoteric point of view, but not from a scientific one.

## Mental

The easiest to understand is the mental level, which is native to our mind, just as the visible physical level is native to our body.

Each of us can see the visible world with our eyes and see the entities of the mental world with our mind, such as ideas, images, thoughts, the essence of things, even concepts like numbers, letters, and words are at the mental level, we don't see them physically until they are written down.

## Energy-informational field

Above the mental level is the energy-informational level, this is the energy-informational field or world, it doesn't matter what to call it, the essence doesn't change. This is the closest subtle world to us if we look up from the mental level. Probably all esoteric teachings tell about it, as well as some philosophical ones, not calling it exactly that, but describing its properties similar to esoteric teachings.

This level is interesting to us because we constantly interact with it, although we don't see it. Moreover, we have our own representation in it - the energy-informational body, or it can be called an energy-informational imprint, so that there is no association with the physical body, as they are completely different.

## What is in the Energy-informational world

The most important thing in the energy-informational field is a kind of EI ocean created by our energy-informational bodies. This is an ocean of creative ideas, dreams, intuitive knowledge, and other mysterious phenomena. All people on earth have a representation in the energy-informational world, and with our energy, we have created this EI ocean.

We, humans, have the ability for weak unconscious interactions through this ocean - for example, when twins feel each other at a distance, or a parent feels their children, or ideas that seem to be in the air are expressed simultaneously by 2 or more people, for example, during brainstorming. There have also been cases of inventions or scientific discoveries made simultaneously by scientists located on different continents. I'll say right away that I don't believe in stronger and especially intentional interactions, such as magic, curses, and shamanism.

Unlike the physical and mental worlds, we mostly don't see the energy-informational world through our energy-informational body, this is only available to people who have opened the so-called third eye by engaging in spiritual practices.

## Laws

The energy-informational world has its own laws, which are difficult to understand using our familiar logic.

### Synergy

One of the main laws of the EI world is synergy. This is when 1 + 1 is more than 2.

To make it more understandable, let's start with an example for the physical and mental levels. Imagine that at the physical level you see 2 people. At the mental level, your mind will also see a group of two people, that is, some separate entity - "a group of two people". This entity simply exists and is inactive.

But if these 2 people start thinking in one direction, they will create something more than a group of two people. They will create something separate and even independent, thanks to the law of synergy.

For example, a couple in love, when they start dating, call themselves WE, not I and she. They even stop thinking of themselves as separate individuals and think of themselves as something whole. Their concentration of energy in one direction, with the help of synergy, has created another energy-informational entity. Let's call it "WE". This entity begins to live independently, and the couple in love begins to care not only about themselves and each other but also about this entity, trying to make sure that it does not wither, but on the contrary, develops. They not only think towards this entity but also produce certain actions and even adjust their life and plans for its sake (then everything usually ends badly, but that's not the point now).

The same thing happens if you and like-minded person are working on an interesting project. You will feel that ideas start flowing like a river, there are many more of them than each of you has individually, you feel a surge of energy. It's more than you have alone. And you also feel a very pleasant feeling, and everything somehow builds and lines up by itself, and time flies unnoticed. It's stronger and more pleasant even than being alone in a state of flow.

So, if you've had something like this, then you created a pendulum. Well, actually, not quite a full-fledged pendulum, but a very tiny pendulum, but nevertheless distinctly felt. If you have developed a sufficient level of sensitivity in yourself, you could quite well feel all these effects described above.

## Pendulums

And here we have come to one of the key entities for understanding the system - this is a pendulum, an entity from the energy-informational field. I took the term "pendulum" from the esoteric teaching "Reality Transurfing", simply because it is well described there.

To better understand the pendulum, let's turn to living nature. The simplest pendulums are a school of fish, a herd of animals, or a flock of birds. Animals and fish, being close to each other, with the help of synergy, create an energy-informational entity, which ultimately controls them.

Of course, humans also have pendulums, and not just one, like fish or animals, but countless.

In the example above, we imagined a couple in love who created a pendulum called WE. Now imagine that there are not two people thinking in the same direction, and therefore forming a pendulum, but millions all over the world. Then they form huge and simply gigantic pendulums. And the bigger the pendulums, the more independent they are. They live their own separate lives and are not only independent of the people who unconsciously created them, but even enslave people themselves, making them their slaves and batteries to feed on their energy. This is because it is human energy that creates the pendulum, and is also its life force. If there were no people under the control of the pendulum, there would be no pendulum itself. Just as if the fish swam in different directions - then the pendulum would disappear.

The good news is that unlike fish, we have consciousness, and we can become aware of ourselves and the surrounding world and consciously get out of the slavery of pendulums forming systems, and consequently out of the entire social system as a whole, becoming completely free and as independent as the whole system.

## Diaphragm between worlds

Between the mental and energy-informational levels, there is an imaginary diaphragm between the worlds, separating these worlds and preventing one level from seeping into another.

This diaphragm is not exactly a separate level of the universe, such as mental and energy-informational, it is rather hypothetical.

In esotericism, it is mentioned as a veil that clouds our vision, as it limits the vision of our mind towards the energy-informational world and generally hinders good vision of the mental world, and consequently, reality.

Unlike esotericists, I call this phenomenon not a veil, but a diaphragm, to emphasize its feature of separating worlds. A pendulum, being in the energy-informational world, cannot directly affect the mental world and even more so the physical world. However, by pressing this diaphragm, it can still exert influence. Imagine rubber stretched on a frame: you can manipulate objects on the other side by denting and stretching this rubber while remaining hidden. On the other side, you are not visible, although you influence that side.

This is approximately how pendulums affect us at the mental level: they create a depression into which unconsciously living people slide, right into the trap of pendulums, from which it is usually difficult to get out.

## More subtle worlds

The spectrum of levels of the universe does not end at the energy-informational world. In esoteric and some philosophical teachings, you can find information about even more subtle worlds, where supposedly our spirit or our ethereal body is located, as well as higher-order entities not represented at the mental or even energy-informational level.

I believe that more subtle worlds and the entities in them do not particularly affect us. They are inert in relation to us, and we are inert in relation to them. Therefore, we will not delve into them within the framework of the Personal Freedom System - these worlds are not important for our model and for gaining freedom.

It's hard to say how many levels exist in total, but I assume that from the energy-informational field upwards, they go in a soft gradient, smoothly flowing into each other, so it's difficult to distinguish where one level ends and another begins.

We are interested only in such concepts as soul and spirit. The soul is like a group of our representations at several levels, starting from the energy-informational field and higher, and the spirit is in the highest worlds. If we definitely feel the soul, people with a more developed sensitivity feel it even more distinctly, then the spirit is barely felt, and only highly spiritually developed people feel it distinctly.

## Let's summarize

- We are multidimensional beings, represented at all levels simultaneously
- But only at the physical and mental levels do we have vision. For example, with our mind we see such a concept as culture, and with our eyes we see its manifestation in the form of patterns on traditional costumes, we see dances and hear songs
- The energy-informational world seems quite as real as the mental one. In addition to all kinds of phenomena and laws of this world, we can clearly observe, at least, the law of synergy and pendulums, forming both global social and political phenomena, and the simplest pendulums called WE in people in love and in people thinking in one direction
- We have become acquainted with the subtle worlds where our representations are located, but the most interesting to us are spirit and especially soul, as it is primarily associated with finding happiness
- And of course, today we have become acquainted with such a concept as a pendulum, key to understanding the system
