First of all, they created all these problems they loudly claim to have. Secondly, all their problems are related to men. Thirdly, their problems are not really problems, but pressure on men. They try to convince men of their problems, and if a naive "deer" man agrees to help, he will harm another man or male society as a whole.

The essence of women's problems is always the man's fault, and she is the poor unfortunate victim.

She implicitly, manipulatively offers a solution on how to deal with the man who is the culprit of her problems. She appeals to the "fighting scarlet man." And the woman makes it so that it seems to the deer who agrees to help that he himself made such a decision and thought of the solution to this problem and his help will solve something and will be very important. And of course the woman will certainly pat him on the head, praise him or set him as an example to other men. But this is again a manipulation in order to fix the necessary positive confirmations on the one hand and to induce other men to "help" women, because they will know that they will also be praised and patted on the head.

## Women's issues:

- She earns little in an easy and irresponsible job, but wants to earn a lot as in a responsible job while doing nothing. What can I say? Infantilization is her problem, not ours.
- Can't find a normal man, says men are getting rusty. That's a clear indication that she's an idiot. She's set up rigid filters that normal men don't pass through. The man she wants, the one she dreams of, will not humiliate himself in front of her, passing through her filters and barriers.
- The husband's lying on the couch doing nothing. This is a manipulation to show people their own heroism (which is not really there) that supposedly she is the only one pulling the relationship and family, and he does nothing. The purpose of this manipulation is to pressure the man into doing what is to her advantage - in this case working more and giving her money and/or doing the housework for her. The stereotype of a man lying on the couch, women in advance laid in the consciousness of society, so women constantly repeat it exactly to achieve their goals. Although in fact the man is just resting after work and there is no problem
- Ex-husband does not let her see her children, sets the children against her. This is quite insolence, because this is what women themselves do and they have put in the public consciousness stereotype that men are bad fathers. If you hear something like this - it is a blatant lie in order to denigrate your husband in your eyes and increase the pressure on him from the immediate environment and society as a whole
- Husband does not pay alimony. Please, just don't believe that child support has anything to do with the good of the children. **Alimony should be abolished!** It is a slavery of men and it does not bring happiness to children. Women spend the money almost always on themselves, not on the child. That's why they fight so hard for it. Alimony is the foundation of their female "independence."
- Husband beats her - she brought him on herself, she provoked him. A man doesn't just hit, unlike a woman. Although we have been indoctrinated that on the contrary, a man can hit just like that, and a woman is always innocent. In [this article](2022-how-we-should-treat-reports-of-domestic-violence) I wrote in more detail about the problems of violence in the family
- Husband's an alcoholic or a gambling addict - you drove him to it.
- Problems with mother-in-law - we do not care at all. Let them learn to get along.

## Women treat men who believe in their problems like suckers

For women who talk about their problems, the man who listens to them is always a deer, naive and a sucker. Women often just talk about their problems left and right in order to identify the stalkers and set society up to solve their problems.

Having received positive reinforcement of his actions after helping a woman, a deer will continue to serve women with great zeal, because he wants to get again pleasant feelings of gratitude and a sense of fulfilled duty to society (obviously, women's). But in reality women will not even feel respect for him, for them he is a sucker and a slave.

## What are the consequences if we support their problems?

- By supporting women's issues, you increase the pressure women and feminists put on men, and therefore make men's lives worse. They often disguise the pressure on men's society as their own problems - for example, they create the illusion of women's disadvantage and demand that half of the men in the workplace be fired and women be hired.
- On the other side of the coin, there is always a deceived man. Solving a woman's problem = creating a problem for another man. By helping her, you are making life worse for one man and implicitly for the entire male community
- Deer, helping a woman, for example, to take a child away from her ex-husband, increases the likelihood that someday the child will be taken away from him. Because he himself has invested in the creation of this common reality.
- Helping women, you get nothing but lies and illusions. They themselves will not help you with such problems.

## What's the reality

- Women have no restrictions on their rights and haven't for at least 100 years. They have always had the right to work, including hard labor, they just don't want to. They study alongside boys in schools and universities. They drive cars and enjoy all the benefits of civilization
- Women have more rights than men and fewer responsibilities. They do not have to go to the army, they have a lower retirement age, in marriage and divorce a man has no rights and has a lot of responsibilities, a woman, on the contrary, has no responsibilities and has much more rights. In general, the list goes on and on
- The man is an alcoholic, aggressor, gambler, she herself has brought to it
- Can not find a good man because she herself is a fool.
- Women often parasitize on the male instinct, which is called in MD "Female in danger", although I would call "Weak member of society in danger", because they do not in vain press on the nobility of the deer and expose themselves as a victim in order to activate this instinct. Then the deer will more willingly agree to help, because he knows that then he will feel good - there will be a sense of accomplished duty, praise and recognition of society. Unfortunately, the unhappy deer does not know that all this is a lie and manipulation
- The world for the average woman is very comfortable and not comfortable for the average man.

Well, in general you understood - all their problems are lies, manipulation and pressure on men and they solve them at the expense of naive men-alien. Therefore, we should not support them and listen to their problems and allow ourselves to be treated like an aleny.

And another very important point - **women absolutely don't care about men's problems**. Think about it.
