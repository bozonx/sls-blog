title: How does a person get into the system
date: 2023-08-26T12:00-03:00
description: The system uses various manipulations to draw victims into its game and into the system's trap. It substitutes concepts, builds a cocoon of information around the victim and bombards her with false statements that are disguised as true. In this way it creates a whole fictional world that seems real to the victim. The goal of the system is to get into the core of the victim's personality where it will gain control over the victim's subconscious and use it to attract other victims. And for the victim, it threatens an unsettling and unhappy life.

The ideas and the systems behind them spread like a virus through
societies, infecting people's minds and often leading to destructive consequences.
consequences and, above all, the loss of personal freedom.

## Already in the system

Unfortunately if you're not free and you haven't realized your freedom yet.
freedom, you're under the power of many systems and you don't see them yet.
They hide themselves and they distort your vision so that you not only don't
detect their destructive influence on you, but through you they're
they're doing things that are for the good of the system that you don't even
realize.

Through you, the [pendulum](https://dzen.ru/a/ZNuGYufcik0jd3h1) underlying the system is gaining new supporters and counteracting
its opponents. It speaks from your lips as you endorse the system and
when you endorse the system and recruit others into it, or when you attack those who are in a
a competing system or trying to get out of your system. Under the influence
of the system, you can unconsciously show latent aggression even if you're
you're good to that person.

## Growing up we are enslaved by the system

After a period of childhood, we are enslaved to at least a few systems. These are.
first of all the natural system and the system of the state and
the state ideology system, but there are other systems as well.
Among them there are global as well as local ones related to a particular region or nation.
region or nation.

## New artificial systems

Throughout your life you can be pulled by different systems. The most
most notable are sects, conspiracy theories, social movements, religious
and political systems.

But you can also fall under the sway of some other milder ideology, value system, sub-system.
softer ideologies, value systems, subcultures, fashions, or even
the marketing strategies of brands that build religion around
their brand. Such ideologies are usually not very destructive, which means we won't look at them closely.

But I don't see anything wrong with subcultures, fashion, and even some
spiritual ideologies. Even if a person believes in astrology, human design.
and human design and other ideas that are divorced from reality.
there's usually not much harm, there's not much good.

## How the system pulls in

To draw in new adherents, a destructive system uses soft manipulation in the beginning.
soft manipulation in the beginning. And the more a person becomes immersed in the system.
the more manipulation it uses. And if a person falls into
deep into the trap of the system, then it doesn't have to pretend to be
and treat the victim gently, it can manipulate them hard.
manipulate the victim like a dominant wife manipulates her husband.
and no longer speaks to him in a commanding tone.
in a commanding tone.

## First you have to invade the victim's mind

In order to gain control of the victim, the manipulator, in this case.
the system, needs to invade the victim's mind, specifically the core
of the victim's personality that protects the mind. And once inside the core personality
of the personality, the system expands its control over the victim and takes over the victim.
full use of the victim.

## Information cocoon

The system needs the victim to come to it, and to do this it needs to bring the victim to the necessary awareness.

In the beginning, the system slowly places the victim in an information cocoon.
It wraps the victim in the right information so that the victim unconsciously
to unconsciously start thinking in the right direction.

The person's thought energy is the very purpose
for which the system is doing all this. It's the life of the system, or rather the pendulum.
that's behind it. The pendulum needs to get the victim's thought energy
of the victim on its own wave, then the pendulum can receive the victim's energy and control it
control it for its own purposes and narrow the victim's vision.
so it's harder for them to find their way out.

As an example of cocooning manipulation, you can think back to your
former relationship with a woman, she was always picking up on her desired
pattern of behavior in movies and TV shows, and she was sure to voice it so that you would get
you get the right impression of how to behave in a relationship with a woman.
in a relationship with a woman. She did it regularly and casually, as if by accident, like.
just commenting on the show, she would approve of the scenes where the man was playing
the role of a woman's slave and condemned scenes where the man was free and
and independent and living for himself.

## Everything is slow and smooth

The system does everything deliberately slow and smooth because our minds are not good at [timeline](https://dzen.ru/b/Y0aBJEQ5mDEzYbuG), they are not good at noticing small changes in time.

## Manipulations must be effective.

It's very important that the manipulation is always effective, so that the system
not only hides itself, but also trains the victim to obey. That's why
that's why at first very soft and unencumbering
manipulation, because harsher and more demanding manipulations can push away
a victim who's not yet fully under the control of the system.

## Soft manipulation

The problem with soft manipulation is that it's virtually impossible
to recognize, even to a person who's good at it, because they are
disguised as good intentions. That makes it hard to tell if the person
person or idea is really good or just pretending to be.

## Masquerading as a do-gooder

In general in the beginning, the manipulator masquerades as a do-gooder. The person
manipulator may actually do you some good deed,
smiling all the time and giving you positive vibes. And a destructive system
can reward you with the feeling that you're in a society of good and kind
people, where you are very welcome and genuinely interested in you. And you'll have
a calm, relaxed and pleasant feeling. And in that
relaxed state, it's easier to invade the victim's core personality. A prime
example is cults-- it's their primary first-stage manipulation for
to pull their victims in.

## Good for a while

But fear not, neither the manipulator nor the destructive system can pretend to be kind for long.
to pretend to be kind for long, it's too difficult and too much of a waste of
of energy. Soon enough, the system will move on to a more harsh and
more demanding manipulations, which will be much easier
to recognize and react accordingly.

## Tilted plane

The most common soft manipulation is [inclined plane](https://dzen.ru/a/Y4XLwsgKxndQUhGt).
It is a universal manipulation that is used as individuals,
like women over their male slaves, politicians, marketers,
negotiators, and entire systems.

In short, the essence of manipulation is to warp the victim's
vision of the mind so that it rolls in the direction the manipulator wants it to roll,
and away from the wrong direction.

## The system blinds us to trust.

An important goal of the system, in addition to getting the victim hooked, is to hide itself. And it can do this by inducing trust in the victim.

Unfortunately, in our psyche we have such a mechanism that with the emergence of trust in a person, group or idea, our mind is blinded. But this is more true for not very developed people. As the personality develops, the vision of the mind expands greatly and it is no longer so easily blinded.

For example, falling in love in a man completely blinds him to all the shortcomings of a woman, which she actively uses, making him her slave and siphoning off all the resources and vital energy from him.

> Here you can draw the wrong conclusion, which means that you should not trust anyone and anything. No. The correct conclusion is that you have to evolve.

## Core personality

As I said earlier, the goal of the system is to get into the victim's core personality to gain control over it. The personality core protects the mind. But unfortunately that protection is not 100 percent. The mind can be tricked, for example, by spiking a good idea with a bad idea to sort of ride on that idea. The mind gets caught up and misses the bad idea along with the good idea.

## Assertion bombardment

The system also bombards the victim with assertions that come from the information cocoon, these assertions accumulate near the mind's defenses, compose themselves into parts of the new illusory world and when the mind fails they make their way into the core of the victim's personality.

Bombardment begins after the phase of the do-gooder and continues until the moment of false realization, when the victim already falls under the full control of the system. And the bombardment is very active, with various assertions falling like snow on the victim's head.

## Cloaking the claims

A characteristic feature is that the bombardment does not use only one targeted assertion. They are mixed with a bunch of other ones in order not to be intrusive and for the mind of a person to sift out the unnecessary and come to the right conclusions. That's why often during bombardment absolutely crazy assertions are mixed in. The mind rejects them of course and comes to accept the necessary statements because they seem logical against the general background.

## Awareness

Over time, the system builds up a critical mass of its ideas and assertions in the victim's core personality and the victim has a realization. The victim will exclaim - there it is! That's it! How did I not notice it before! And you are all fools for not seeing it!

At that moment, all the parts of the picture come together and the victim finds himself in a fictitious world created by the system, but for the victim it seems to be reality.

A prime example is the conspiracy theorists, that's what happens to them. They took one idea after another, one twisted fact after another, and then it all came together in their heads in the theory of the golden billion, flat earth and other conspiracy theories.

The problem here is that awareness is desirable and pleasant for the mind and it doesn't even realize that it can be false. It is convinced that realizations only happen in relation to truth. But, unfortunately, this is not the case. Systems are very eager to implant false realizations in the victim because it is a very powerful technique to control the victim, which completely hides the effects of the manipulator. The realizations become part of the victim's personality and are very difficult to eradicate from it, which means the victim will be under guaranteed control and often this is for life.

But don't be frightened, if you evolve, you will eventually protect yourself from false realizations and revise those that have already managed to get into you.

## New World

So, the victim of a destructive idea finds himself in a whole new world that is very detached from reality, but it seems to him that this is reality. This is very important to understand - for the victim the objective reality becomes invisible, the system substitutes its own reality, the one in which the victim will act in the way necessary for the system.

## Final hit

After the realization, the victim's the final hit takes place. The victim sees everywhere confirmation of her theory and the facts she has realized. Her attention is sharpened to some facts and dulled to others. Because of this, the victim becomes immune to criticism and completely turns a blind eye to all facts that contradict her idea.

She passionately begins to search for information on the subject of her new ideology. For example, she reads the literature she is given in the cult. And conspiracy theorists greedily drink information from the appropriate channels, read and watch videos and see more and more confirmations of their theories. And they do it all with pleasure and independently. They supplement their illusory picture of the world with missing information, which completely blocks their vision of reality.

And as a result of this final hit they become a full-fledged member of their system. They may even consciously begin the activity of recruiting new victims.

## Enemies all around

And those who don't share their fictional reality they call stupid and unintelligent. The victim thinks they're the one who's enlightened and everyone else is in the dark.

Because the victim has become a representation of the pendulum on a physical level. And we know that pendulums that are on the same frequency of vibration of thought cannot get along together, they necessarily begin to compete. In the same way the victim begins to divide people into his own and strangers. Strangers for her are of course those who do not share her ideology, even if they are in fact related.

## Why do we need this?

You might ask why exactly I'm bothering with this. And the point is that one of the main manipulation techniques that all manipulators and especially systems use is to keep the victim in a constantly irritated state, and even better to envelope her in an atmosphere of hysteria. For example, such an atmosphere is created by a tyrant woman in the family. In such a state the victim is very well controlled, moreover her vision is very narrowed by the mind and she is unable to see the way out.

Therefore, suffering, anxiety, irritation, anger and other negative emotions exist only in the system, where you can not count on [happiness](https://dzen.ru/media/sls_freedom/chto-takoe-schaste-64e6200fbc5c5b1500dcd02d) at all, it at best only rarely appears and that as a carrot that takes you deep into the system, for example, in marriage with a woman.

But outside the system there is none of this, you get not only freedom, but also the right to absolutely full-fledged happiness, the main enemy of which is just anxiety.

## We're not manipulative

And lastly, we're not manipulative. I'm sure you've had the idea of using some manipulation technique for your own purposes. But I'm sorry to say that using manipulation will put you right back into the system, because manipulators are just as much slaves to the system as their victims, even though they seem to be in a better position.

We study manipulation only for the purpose of getting out of the networks of manipulators and systems.
