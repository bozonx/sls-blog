title: How does a person get into the system
date: 2023-08-26T12:00-03:00
description: The system uses various manipulations to draw victims into its game and into the trap of the system. She substitutes concepts, builds an information cocoon around the victim and bombards her with false statements that disguise themselves as true ones. In this way, she creates a whole fictional world that seems real to the victim. The purpose of the system is to get into the core of the victim's personality in order to gain control over her subconscious. The system draws new victims into its game, using previously enslaved people. For every victim, being enslaved by the system threatens an anxious and unhappy life.

Ideas and systems spread like viruses through societies, infecting people's minds, which often leads to destructive consequences and, primarily, to the loss of personal freedom.

Systems significantly narrow and distort our mind's vision, therefore for developed people or those striving for development, it is necessary not only to exit destructive systems but also to have protection from falling into other systems.

## Already in the System

Unfortunately, if you are not yet free and haven't realized your freedom, you are under the influence of many systems and don't see them yet. They hide themselves and distort your vision so that you not only fail to detect their destructive impact on you but also through you they perform actions that benefit the system and which you don't even realize.

Through you, the [pendulum](2023-the-pendulum-an-entity-from-the-energy-informational-world) underlying the system gains new supporters and counteracts its opponents. It speaks through your lips when you approve of the system and invite others into it or when you attack those who are in a competing system or trying to exit your system. Under the system's influence, you may unconsciously show hidden aggression towards people, even if you have good feelings towards the victim of your unconscious aggression.

## Growing Up, We Are Enslaved by the System

After childhood, we fall into at least several systems. These are primarily the natural system and the state system with its corresponding state ideology, but also other systems. Among them are both global and local ones relating to specific regions or nations.

## New Artificial Systems

Throughout life, different systems may pull you in. The most noticeable are cults, conspiracy theories, social movements, religious and political systems.

But you can also fall under the influence of some other softer ideology, value system, subculture, fashion, or even marketing strategies of brands that build a religion around their brand. Such ideologies are usually not very destructive, which means we won't examine them closely.

By the way, I see nothing wrong with subcultures, fashion, and even some quasi-spiritual ideologies. Even if someone believes in astrology, human design, and other ideas detached from reality, there usually isn't much harm from them, nor benefit.

## How the System Pulls You In

To draw in new supporters, a destructive system initially uses soft manipulations. And the deeper a person sinks into the system, the harsher manipulations it uses. And if a person falls into the deepest trap of the system, it doesn't need to pretend or handle its victim gently anymore — it can harshly manipulate them, like how a dominating wife harshly manipulates her submissive husband and no longer treats him with ceremony, speaking only in commanding tones, although in the early stages of luring the man into her trap, the wife was kind and gentle.

## First, They Need to Invade the Victim's Mind

All these manipulations I'm talking about in this article relate not only to systems but are also used by individual manipulators.

To gain control over a victim, a manipulator or system needs to invade the victim's mind, specifically to get into the victim's core personality, which protects the mind. And once established in the personality core, the system expands its control over the victim and gains full use of them.

## Information Cocoon

The system needs the victim to come to it voluntarily, and for this, it needs to lead them to the necessary realization. Realization, contrary to popular belief, isn't always true, but it's almost always perceived by a person as truth, therefore implanting the necessary realization in the victim is a powerful manipulation that almost excludes the victim from slipping off the hook. The process of leading the victim to the needed realization is long and multi-staged.

Initially, the system gradually places the victim in an information cocoon. It envelops the victim with necessary information so that the victim unconsciously starts thinking in the needed direction.

It is precisely the person's thought energy that is the very goal for which the system does all this. This is the life of the system, or more precisely, the pendulum that stands behind it. The pendulum needs to tune the victim's thought energy to its wave, then the pendulum can receive the victim's energy and at the same time control them for its purposes and significantly narrow the victim's vision so it becomes harder for them to find a way out.

As an example of cocoon-wrapping manipulation, you can recall your past relationships with a woman; she constantly noted the behavior model she needed in films and series and made sure to voice it so that you would form the necessary impression of how to properly behave in relationships with a woman. She did this regularly and as if casually, as if just commenting on the series, she approved of scenes where the man plays the role of a woman's slave and condemned scenes where the man was free, independent, and lived for himself.

## Everything Is Done Slowly and Smoothly

The system does everything deliberately slowly and smoothly because our mind works poorly with the [time scale](https://dzen.ru/b/Y0aBJEQ5mDEzYbuG), it poorly notices insignificant changes over time.

As an example: an alcoholic might think they haven't changed when looking in the mirror in the morning, but if they look at their photo from a year ago, they'll be very surprised. This is all because the mind almost doesn't notice slow changes, and of course, manipulators parasitize on this, both individual personalities and entire systems; this is their favorite technique.

## Manipulations Must Be Effective

It's very important that manipulations are always effective — this way the system not only hides itself but also trains the victim to obey. That's why very soft and unburdensome manipulations are used in the early stages, as more harsh and demanding ones might repel the victim who isn't yet fully under the system's control.

That is, initially, it's not even about the request itself, not about the action that the victim needs to do, but about obedience. The victim needs to act according to the manipulator's or system's direction, even if initially not correctly and not precisely. And over time, the victim is trained and already acts more precisely and doesn't notice the manipulation at all.

## Soft Manipulations

The problem with soft manipulations is that they're practically impossible to recognize, even for someone well-versed in them, because they mask themselves as good intentions. Because of this, it's difficult to say whether this person or idea is truly good or just pretending.

## Masquerading as a Good Person

Initially, the manipulator masquerades as a good person. A manipulative person might actually do something good for you, constantly smile, and give positive emotions. And a destructive system can reward you with a feeling that you've found yourself in a society of good and kind people who are genuinely happy to see you and are sincerely interested in you. And you'll feel peace, relaxation, and pleasant sensations. In such a relaxed state, it's easier to invade the victim's personality core. A bright example is cults — this is their main first-stage manipulation for drawing in their victims.

The manipulator achieves getting the victim to relax and believe in what's happening. That's when they'll hook the victim and like a fisherman will pull them in by the line.

## Good Only Briefly

But don't worry, neither a manipulator nor a destructive system can pretend to be good for long; it's too difficult for them and too much energy expenditure. Soon the system will anyway move to harsher and more demanding manipulations, which will be much easier to recognize and respond to accordingly.

## Slippery Slope

The most common soft manipulation is the [slippery slope](https://dzen.ru/a/Y4XLwsgKxndQUhGt). This is a universal manipulation used by both individual people, for example — women over their male slaves, as well as politicians, marketers, negotiators, and entire systems.

Briefly, the essence of slippery slope manipulation is to distort the victim's mind vision so that they roll in the direction needed by the manipulator and move away from the unwanted direction.

## The System Blinds Us with Trust

An important goal of the system, besides hooking the victim, is to hide itself. And it can do this by inducing trust in the victim.

Unfortunately, in our psyche, we have such a mechanism that with the appearance of trust in a person, group, or idea, our mind becomes blinded. But this applies more to less developed people. With personality development, the mind's vision greatly expands and it's not so easy to blind anymore.

For example, a man's infatuation completely blinds him to all of a woman's faults, which she actively uses, making him her slave and draining all his resources and life energy.

> Here one might make the wrong conclusion that it means you shouldn't trust anyone or anything. No. The correct conclusion is that you need to develop and develop your thinking, then you'll get protection from manipulations.

## Personality Core

As I said earlier, the system's goal is to get into the victim's personality core to gain control over them. The mind stands guard over the personality core. But unfortunately, this protection isn't 100% effective. The mind can be deceived, for example by mixing a little bad with a good idea, to kind of ride on this idea. The mind will doze off and let the bad idea through along with the good one.

## Bombardment with Statements

Also, the system bombards the victim with statements that come from the information cocoon; these statements accumulate near the mind's protection, are composed into parts of a new illusory world, and when the mind slips up, they get into the victim's personality core.

The bombardment begins after the good person phase and continues until the moment of false realization when the victim falls under the system's full control. Moreover, the bombardment happens very actively, different statements just snow down on the victim's head.

## Masking of Statements

A characteristic feature is that during bombardment, not only target statements are used. They are mixed with lots of others to not be intrusive and so that the person's mind would seem to filter out the excess and come to the needed conclusions by itself. Therefore, often during bombardment, completely insane statements are mixed in. The mind naturally rejects these and comes to accept the needed statements because they seem logical against the general background.

## Realization

Over time, the system accumulates a critical mass of its ideas and statements in the victim's personality core, and the victim has a realization. The victim will exclaim — there it is! That's how it is! How didn't I notice this before! And you're all fools for not seeing this!

At this moment, all parts of the picture come together into a whole, and the victim falls into an imaginary world created for them by the system, but for the victim, it seems like reality.

A bright example is conspiracy theorists; this is exactly what happens with them. They accepted one idea after another, one twisted fact after another, and then everything in their head came together into theories about the golden billion, flat earth, and other conspiracy theories.

The problem here is that realization is desirable and pleasant for the mind, and it doesn't even suspect that it could be false. It's sure that realizations can only happen in relation to truth. But, unfortunately, this isn't so. Systems very much want to implant false realizations in the victim because this is a very powerful technique of victim control that completely hides the manipulator's influence. Realizations become part of the victim's personality and are very difficult to eradicate from it, which means the victim will be under guaranteed control and often this is for life.

But don't be scared; if you're developing, then over time you'll protect yourself from false realizations and review those that have already managed to get into you.

## New World

The victim of a destructive idea falls into a completely new world greatly detached from reality, but to them, it seems this is reality. This is very important to understand — for the victim, objective reality becomes invisible; the system substitutes reality with its own, one in which the victim will act in ways needed by the system.

## Finishing Off

After realization comes the finishing off of the victim. The victim sees confirmation of their theory everywhere and facts that they've realized. Their attention sharpens regarding some facts and dulls regarding others. Because of this, the victim becomes impervious to criticism and completely closes their eyes to all facts that contradict the idea implanted in them.

They eagerly begin to search for information on the topic of their new ideology. For example, they avidly read literature given to them in the cult. And conspiracy theorists eagerly absorb information from corresponding channels, read, watch videos, and see more and more confirmation of their theories. Moreover, they do all this with pleasure and independently. They complement their illusory world picture with missing information, which completely blocks their vision of reality.

And as a result of this finishing off, they become full-fledged members of their system. They might even consciously begin activities to attract new victims.

## Enemies All Around

And those who don't share their imagined reality, they call fools and understand nothing. The victim thinks that they are the one who has seen the light, while everyone else wanders in darkness.

Since the victim has become like a representative of the pendulum at the physical level. And we know that pendulums operating at the same thought vibration frequency can't coexist; they must compete. Similarly, the victim begins to divide people into us and them. Others for them are of course those who don't share their ideology, even if they are actually related by family ties.

## Why Do We Need This?

You might ask why specifically I should bother with this. And the thing is that one of the main manipulation techniques used by all manipulators and especially systems is to keep the victim in a constantly irritated state, and even better to envelop them in an atmosphere of hysteria. For example, such an atmosphere is created by a tyrannical woman in the family. In such a state, the victim is very well controlled; moreover, their mind vision is significantly narrowed so they are unable to see the way out.

Therefore suffering, anxiety, irritation, anger, and other negative emotions exist only in the system, where [happiness](2023-what-is-happiness) can't be counted on at all; at best it only appears occasionally and then only as a carrot leading the victim deeper into the system, for example into marriage with a woman.

But outside the system, none of this exists; you get not only freedom but also the right to absolutely full-fledged happiness, whose main enemies are precisely anxiety and irritation.

## We Are Not Manipulators

And finally, I'll say that we are not manipulators. Surely you've had the idea to use some manipulation technique for your own purposes. But I'll have to disappoint you that using manipulations will immediately return you to the system because manipulators are just as much slaves to the system as their victims, even though it seems they are in a more advantageous position.

We study manipulations only with the goal of disentangling ourselves from the networks of manipulators and systems.

## Both Men and Women Can Fall Into the Trap

It's important to understand that both men and women can equally become victims of manipulation, fall into cults, and under any other bad influence. But there are small differences — men gradually go down the slippery slope into the trap, while women hold out for a long time but then fall in sharply. And when exiting the system, there are also differences - in general, it's a bit easier for a man to exit than for a woman, even from such cruel systems as cults.
