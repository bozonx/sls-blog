## Finance

A man in a marriage earns money to support himself and his family. Women in marriage earn money for themselves and secretly from their husbands make deposits, buy or mortgage a house, which they rent out. They argue that when he leaves me, I will have a place to live and I will get something from the marriage. At the same time, she herself lives at the expense of her husband. That means that her husband is implicitly invested in her secret dwelling or deposit.

A man in search of a wife strives to have a good income in order to find a beautiful wife. A woman in search of a man spends money on cosmetics, nice clothes and beauty treatments to find a man of extremely high wealth and even more than one.

Men get benefits through their hard work, creativity, taking reasonable risks, managing their business or capital. Women benefit by manipulating and parasitizing men.

## Relationships and Family

For men, establishing a relationship with a woman is challenging and requires a great deal of effort, energy, time and finances. Therefore, the vast majority of men simply can not afford a relationship with more than one woman, moreover, difficulties arise even with finding one woman. Many women, even when married, continue to dress and behave provocatively to attract more men and receive benefits not from one man, but from several. To do this, she does not need to do anything special, just “watch herself” and do not need moral principles, they only get in the way.

A man faces a lot of difficulties that a woman creates for him when dating and in the relationship, but he overcomes everything because he loves his wife. Women do not experience any difficulties in dating and in relationships, they receive only benefits. Moreover, she creates a lot of difficulties for a man, because she thinks that this way she checks his love and that he should deserve a woman. But in fact it is a very harsh manipulation, strongly psychologically binding the man, because of which after the breakup of the relationship, the man will arrive in a very difficult mental state.

It is extremely difficult for a man to change a woman. He loses a lot if he leaves a woman. He is strongly attached to her emotionally through female manipulation, as well as legally through marriage - he will lose children and property in a divorce. A woman can easily change a man, she loses nothing, only gains. She acquires half of the man's property, takes the children away from their father and gets the sole right to dispose of the children, and gets a lot of goodies from the new man. So she doesn't get called a whore, she just says she's in love with someone else. And since it is love, it means you can cheat and moreover it is even a noble treason.

Men in general sincerely love a woman and go to great lengths for her sake, even to their own detriment. Women have learned to control their feelings and use them to manipulate men. A woman's love is not the same as a man's, a woman is selfish and mercantile. A man on the contrary is altruistic and generous. Women have learned to manage even their sexual desire and can stand a man deliberately and very cruelly to shake a lot of material goods out of him.

Men care about the psychological health of their women, love and take care of women even in spite of their mental well-being. Women, on the other hand, are often very cruel to a man's psyche, but take great care of their own.

For the sake of a relationship, a man may make sacrifices and humiliations. For the sake of preserving the relationship, a woman will not even go to the extent of apologizing.

Happiness and the future of children is very important to men. A man will not dare to take the mother away from the child, because he knows that the child will not be happy in this case. It is enough for women that the child was fed and clothed, the future and even more so the happiness of the child does not matter to them. That is why it is not worth it for women to take away a child's father, which, unfortunately, is happening in Russia.

## Society

Men have moral values, justice, principles and altruism because they are necessary to build a just society.

Women do not have moral principles and altruism because women do not strive to build a just society. Society is built by men and women just use what men create. Women recognize moral principles only where it benefits them, but they do not recognize real equality, they want undeservedly more rights for themselves and less rights for men.

Men tend to unite for the sake of achieving common interests - these are social organizations, business, political parties and the like.

Women unite to pressure men. But they do not unite for the common good for all. Since there is no need to do so, they have learned to manipulate men to extract benefits for women. They do not strive to create a just society, unlike men.

Men make friends to get high, to have an interesting time and enjoy socializing, sharing information, as well as for mutual assistance and to p

## Success and Career

Men go to university to learn a profession to successfully advance in life. Women study at university to be among a large number of men and find a rich daddy's son there and successfully settle down in life at his expense.

Men learn English and other languages to work in foreign companies and advance in career or business. Women learn foreign languages in order to find a rich foreigner, as compared to Russian men, and live off him.

Men strive to understand the outside world, at least the part that concerns them. Women do not strive to understand the outside world, as there is no need for it, everything is done and taken care of by a man.

Men achieve success in science or in show business due to their extraordinary talents and great labor. A woman in show business achieves success only if she has found a talented man and parasitizes on him. You can be sure that behind every female star is a squeezed faded but incredibly talented man at the expense of which she became popular, or a rich man who sponsored her. The same goes for scientific dissertations, I myself have watched women defend their dissertations, but they did it with the hands of men who were manipulated. Women gave the impression that if a man made her thesis, she would give him sex, but of course she did not give anything in the end, because she is not obliged to give sex to everyone, but the thesis was made for her. In some cases, when there is a clear goal, a woman can and sleep with whom it is necessary. But more often it's just parasitizing on talented men.

Men are not a stranger to the hardest work for the happiness of their families. Women do not strive to work, but if they do work, they choose the simplest and most irresponsible work. Although they demand that such work should be paid as difficult and responsible, as if they see discrimination against women.

Men solve their problems on their own, women do not help them. Women at work often use men for solving urgent problems, but they are not even going to learn something to solve their problems on their own.

A man cannot afford to be helpless, irresponsible and lazy if it is a matter of survival. But he can be lazy in between jobs, but that's just a vacation. A woman can afford to be lazy, useless, uninitiated and helpless at all times. Because a man does everything for her, and often more than one.

## Conclusion

We have looked at the cardinal differences between women's and men's thinking and priorities. In short, men are creators, and women parasitize on them. Women do not need freedom, they have personal slaves - men, so women develop only in the direction of manipulation over men. But men need freedom like air, that's why I created the Personal Freedom System project.
