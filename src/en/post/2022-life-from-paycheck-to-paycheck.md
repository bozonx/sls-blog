That's how many people live and it's considered the norm. But what's wrong with it?

## First, it's the illusion of stability

It's an illusion. There is no stability at all. As soon as something unforeseen happens: the company goes bankrupt, an employee is laid off or falls ill, all stability immediately disappears, especially given the Russian realities with gray wages. But a white salary does not give much more stability.

For clarity, let's compare it to an investor who invests in various stocks and other financial instruments. Even if he is unlucky and fails in one direction, he will not lose everything, but only a small part and will still stay afloat and his standard of living will not even change. And a worker loses almost everything when he loses his job and his standard of living will change a lot, because he had one single source of income and no other.

## In a job you don't like, you lose your freedom, your independence, and it's hard for you to stand up for your principles.

Often employers overstep their authority and force employees to do things:

- Work overtime without extra pay
- Take unpaid vacations
- Write a resignation letter if there is a disagreement with the employer.
- Do things that are not part of their duties
- Or even go beyond your principles and views at all.
- And all this under the fear of dismissal and remain without a job, and therefore without money. And also under the fear of dismissal on a bad article.

## An example of how an employer breaks employees, forcing them to violate their principles.

Sima-Land company in Russia forces employees to participate in actions supporting the current government in Russia (2021, 2022) under the threat of dismissal, which strongly contradicts the political views of some employees. It is obviously difficult to be a free person and an honest person under such conditions.

## When living from paycheck to paycheck, a person is doomed to work until retirement

Upon retirement, one is doomed to receive miserable pennies (in Russia) and drag out a miserable existence. In comparison, a person with financial freedom can retire when he wants to. Also, relying on social benefits makes a person dependent. Benefits are just handouts.

The main thing to realize is that living from paycheck to paycheck will not make you happy, free, independent, but just the opposite. But there is an alternative - it is financial freedom, and we free people will strive for it.
