You have analyzed your environment, as we discussed in [the article on how to get out from under manipulation](2022-how-to-get-out-from-under-manipulation-first-we-discover-the-connections), and you have discovered the manipulators around you and how they bind you and affect you negatively. Yes, you have to admit that, unfortunately, you have fallen victim to them. But you should not blame and blame yourself for this.

Manipulators have developed their skills all their lives and act slowly, step by step, so that the victim would not notice their influence. On manipulation can fall absolutely any person, even with the appearance of strong. But once you learn to recognize them, you will never fall under the manipulator's power again.

That is, you are not guilty of being caught on the hook of the manipulator, the manipulator himself sought with the help of deception and hidden influences to fool you. He is guilty, but you suffer.

If you have been trading or playing poker, you know that sometimes it is better to lose some part and accept it. It's better to stay afloat and lose a little than to lose a lot and go under. It is the same here - you need to recognize your losses and you will have to accept them, but the main thing is not to allow big losses.

When a person is under the power of a manipulator-parasite, he is deprived of choice, the victim's choice is predetermined by the manipulator. But nevertheless the victim still has a choice to leave, but it is not obvious and the manipulator carefully hides it so that the victim does not even suspect that he does not owe the manipulator anything and can quietly leave. Once again, the victim always has two choices - to stay or to leave.

To prevent the victim from leaving, the manipulator creates obstacles, parasitizing on the high moral principles and performance of the victim, and also creates an illusion of pain that will come if the victim leaves. But it's all just an illusion.

Feel sorry for yourself in a good way. But don't nag. You are a good person, kind, responsible, developed, executive with high moral principles. All these qualities you have developed for yourself, not for the manipulator. You don't deserve to be treated badly. Yes, you have fallen into the power of a manipulator-parasite, but you can get out of it and remain a good person and not fall under manipulation. You deserve better!

## Imagine what a happy and happy life you will have without manipulators:

- You'd be happy and free
- Without a manipulator, you'll have the energy and strength to get on with your projects.
- You won't owe anyone anything, you'll have a stone fall from your soul.
- It's an amazing lightness and calmness.
- You will go away negative thoughts, which are often a consequence of parasitizing manipulator over the victim. And your mind will be cleared and clear.
- You can use your altruism for a good cause - to participate in charitable and environmental actions and organizations. Instead of giving your energies to a selfish manipulator who will not even say thank you

## Remember

- That the victim is not a sucker! And is not guilty of falling under the manipulator's power, but the aggressor is the manipulator. Don't overturn justice - the aggressor is always guilty, the victim is not.
- You are not the only one who fell for these tricks, if you feel strong, you can tell other people about manipulation, then it will be easier for them to detect and get out of it
- Don't try to correct the manipulator, he has developed his skills for a long time. As we have already said: you have only 2 choices - stay or leave. The rest is just an illusion. Even if you try to fix him, he will definitely use it to get you even more hooked
- A manipulator will never repent. After all, parasitism is his whole life and otherwise he can not and does not want to, without manipulation he is worthless.

If necessary, consult a competent psychologist or psychotherapist. The manipulator may have developed a disorder or depression in you.

Just don't become a manipulator too, it's a path to nowhere. But by learning to recognize manipulation and manipulators you will be truly free!
