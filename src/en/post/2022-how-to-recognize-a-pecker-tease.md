Dynamist is a woman who initially on dates sets the goal to use a man with the help of deception in her own selfish interests and she initially did not intend to build a relationship with him or have sex with him. As you understand, for men it will not end well, so you should try to recognize the dinamshchitsy and jump off their manipulations as early as possible. The problem is that dinamshchitsy very well disguised and pretend and recognize them at an early stage is extremely difficult or even impossible, especially for the average man who has not studied deeply "mysterious", in fact self-serving female soul and their manipulations.

A man gains absolutely nothing in this kind of communication, but only loses - loses money, time and gets a blow to self-esteem. And the worst thing is that the dynamist can bring a man into psychological slavery, a state where a man is ready for anything to achieve an illusory goal to achieve her favor. This is an incredibly cruel and destructive manipulation of binding, which is very bad and destructive effect on the psyche of the victim and destroys his life.

It should be understood that you can not justify dinamshchits that they are women, they choose a man, and therefore it is noble - she should not sleep with the first man she meets. These excuses can be heard even from men, but even worse, from psychologists. But we must realize that the dynamist originally set mercantile goals and the search for a man for a relationship was not part of her plans. This is deception and manipulation - and therefore should already be censured, not praised. Don't overturn justice - the manipulative woman is a manipulator and therefore an aggressor and she should be censured and punished, not the victim. Therefore, you should not ridicule other men who have fallen for the tricks of dynamist women.

## Brief essence of manipulation

Dynamist creates excessive attraction in the victim, parasitizing on the image of an ideal woman for men, uses emotional swings to bind the man, and also creates the illusion that soon there will be sex and they will have a wonderful relationship. And the longer she keeps the balance - pushing sex away and keeping the man's sexual desire in a very heated state, the more she gets goodies, such as the man's advances, pleasures, emotions, a great time, an expensive dinner at a restaurant and of course expensive gifts.

## Once again, the main points

- Dynamist initially deceives a man, she has no goal to have sex with him and build a good relationship with him
- Her goals are mercantile, nothing noble about them.
- In order for her to achieve her goals she uses a very cruel technique of psychological binding, which is destructive to the victim.
- She parasitizes on a strong male instinct - the instinct of reproduction, so women are easily manipulated and men find it very difficult to recognize them, because the instinct of reproduction clouds the mind.
- A man gains nothing, but loses a lot. She, on the contrary, loses nothing but gains a lot.
- Society approves of dynamos.

This is why we must deal with these manipulations so that we don't let anyone ruin our lives so harshly.

Next, let's talk about [stages of manipulation](2022-the-stages-of-manipulation-of-pecker-teases).
