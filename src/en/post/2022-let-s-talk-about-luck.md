How the average person perceives luck:

It is the unexpected and unreasonable occurrence of some event that has a positive effect. If the effect is negative, it is interpreted as bad luck.

So the main thing here is that the event is interpreted as unexpected and independent of the person and other factors.

The Personal Freedom System interprets it as luck:

We think in probabilities, that is, there is a certain percentage of probability of occurrence of some event. For example, winning a small prize in an instant lottery has a probability of 10%, which means that you have to make 10 attempts and on the 10th attempt you can win a small prize. There may even be a probability of luck, say 20%. That is, for every 10 tries you have a 1 in 5 chance that you will get lucky. And the luck is that the lucky try may fall before the 10th. At the same time the probabilities remain the same and at the next series of 10 attempts luck may not occur and the winning attempt will be only on the 10th time, although in the first series you were lucky to win on the 3rd attempt.

So there are definitely probabilities and they don't go anywhere even if we are lucky.

And an ordinary person at occurrence of luck starts to consider that it is probability, i.e. if he won from the 2nd try he considers that probability of winning is 50% and this mistake can cost him dearly if he wants to try luck again especially in life situations and in business. Also a normal person can treat winning on the 10th try as a failure, i.e. he hopes only for luck and normal probability does not suit him, which is fundamentally wrong.

In fact, luck differs from failure only in the way it is perceived by the individual.
