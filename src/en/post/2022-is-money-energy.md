Is money really energy, as esotericists claim, or is it a very prosaic thing? Let's understand.

I will express my opinion based on my experience and knowledge that I have analyzed and was able to develop a certain opinion on this subject. But of course I do not stop and continue to study the topic of finance.

I strongly disagree with the statement that "money is energy and if you tune into this energy, money will flow to you". There is no evidence for this. But I understand why there are so many esoteric opinions about money - there is really something in the phenomenon of money that does not fall under logical definitions. Namely the statement that "money comes for a purpose", which I have heard many times at different financial courses/trainings/videos/books, strangely enough even where there is no esotericism.

## The universe doesn't have money, only people have it

You can ask the universe or god to send you money, it will not happen simply because money is a valuable resource and no one will give it to you for nothing. I recommend getting rid of these infantile dreams. Yes, if you sit down with an outstretched hand, then surely a passerby will give you some change, but it is unlikely that this is what you dreamed of. With a lot of money no one just part with it, because they have a great value, much more than a handful of coins that can throw a beggar.

## Ways of making money have been known for a long time

- Hired labor or self-employment, i.e. income from one's labor activity.
- Business - to receive a portion of the company's income
- Investments - to receive a percentage of the invested capital.
- Unreliable or unacceptable types of income such as inheritance, winnings, gifts, crime, marriage scams, high-risk investments, casinos and the like.

And where is the money requested from the universe? Maybe winning the lottery? Well, okay, but can you manage it and where's the guarantee that there will ever be another win? Maybe someone will lose a suitcase of money - unlikely, it is too valuable resource, and in general then someone will be unhappy without his suitcase. Let's agree that we will not consider fraudulent, unreliable and near-criminal ways of getting money.

## It's important to understand

- Money is a value that is given to you in exchange for something corresponding to that value - work done or goods.
- If you receive money without giving value in return, it is fraud. Is that what people ask God or the universe for?
- Almost everything about money is math, so there's no room for faith or magic.
- You have to learn how to manage money. Handling a worker's wage and investment capital are not the same thing.

But there is one thing. Money comes from purpose, more specifically from mission, and even more specifically from value. If you create value, for example, a project needed by society, then money will come, seemingly miraculously. But everything is logical, you have created a value that people need and people give money for this value. So there is no esotericism here. Just look more broadly - the process of getting money is not only a transaction between two people, but your company is a generator of value that people go to and give money to get the corresponding value.

**That is the most important thing is value, there will be value, there will be money.**

And lastly one more point - until a person learns to manage money - to control expenses, to save and manage capital, to choose the best sources of income or to have several, then no wealth is out of the question. If a worker suddenly gets a large sum of money, he will dispose of it as he knows how, and he only knows how to spend, so he will spend it all. And if he has already learned to manage, even if his income is not large, he will use this money to increase his passive income and become rich.

That's all and there's no magic involved.
