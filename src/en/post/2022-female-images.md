Women create attractive images for men in clothing, behavior and in general try on a variety of different and proven images, the ideas of which they draw from various sources of information such as television, the Internet, social networks, from girlfriends, from women's magazines and simply by observing other women.

Not once have I heard objections from some women that they dress for themselves, not for men.  But we realize that if they were dressing for themselves, they would prefer comfortable clothes, but sexy clothes and shoes are often uncomfortable. They wouldn't wear thongs, heels, tight clothes, or short skirts and shorts. The same goes for images; they wouldn't portray innocent girls, femme fatales and the like unless those images were aimed at men. Women deny this in order to hide their manipulative influence on men.

## What do they do it for?

If you think they want to find love and the one man on earth with whom she will be happy, you are very wrong. Let me explain what manipulation is:

Women have learned through experience and word-of-mouth and the internet that there are specific images that lure men. So all she has to do is just try on one of the images, such as a sports bitch in tight shorts that show her genitals. And of course men themselves will come to her with gifts, as this image causes increased sexual interest in men and as if says: "I am ready for mating and I have good genes since I am beautiful, and if you want me, you need to interest me to pay attention to you. And she does not need to do anything else, only to sift and leave those men who will bring more gifts.

Have you noticed that this strategy has nothing to do with finding one single man to pair with?

She gets confirmation that it all works and eventually becomes an expert in transformation and image change. I have observed this even in women 45-50 years old, let alone young women. Married ladies even act in this way, they try on different images and wear provocative outfits, at the expense of their husbands, and tell their husbands that they just want to look good, of course for his favorite (actually no).

Once in their youth, these women dreamed of finding the one and only, but already in 16-18 years they start to actively trade themselves and by 20-22 years they become burned-out women (someone later, someone earlier), who very skillfully manipulate men, squeezing tons of nishtaks out of them. Their innocent images obscure men's eyes and do not let them see the real essence of these women. By the way, it is not uncommon for a woman to have about 20 sexual partners by the age of 18 and even more in the friend zone.

## Maybe it's instinct?

We're not going to talk about women's instincts here. Women, trying on images, actually use reason and positive confirmations of previous experience, not instincts. And they manipulate men because they don't want to work, they are infantile and don't want to take responsibility for themselves.

They came to infantile life at the expense of men with the help of reason, not instincts. Why do you need to work if you can parasitize on a man? Moreover, the man will be happy to serve, and will be proud that he got such a gentle and sensual beauty, and not some whore.
