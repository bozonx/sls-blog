"When we fight with my wife, I always look down on her! Because I'm the boss of the house, and it's easier to prove it from the closet."

What are we looking at here? Abuse, female domination of men, toxic female behavior, double standards (abusing men is allowed, abusing women is forbidden). But it's all made out to be something funny, although of course there's nothing funny about abusive behavior.

The point is to slip the reader the right idea under the sauce of humor. Everyone loves humor and it causes positive emotions and even such a toxic situation is associated with positive emotions and the most important thing is that the subtext does not cause rejection because of humor and passes into the subconscious, where it reinforces already existing attitudes.

Thus, for the reader of this post, abusive behavior towards a man does not cause negativity and rejection. Of course, from one such publication will not penetrate the false belief into the core of the personality, but if there are many such confirmations, it creates the impression that this is a very common phenomenon, that the world is just like that. Then the belief imperceptibly passes through the filter of the personality core and remains there. Unfortunately, many men and almost all women already have such a belief in the core of their personality. That is why they do not perceive aggression and abusive behavior on the part of women towards men as something bad, they may even find it funny.

## But how can we tell if the situation is negative if our beliefs don't let us see the point?

It's simple - reverse the roles, put the man in the woman's place and you will see that everything will play out in completely different colors. If before that you did not notice aggression and violence from the side of a woman towards a man, then having changed the roles, aggression from a man to a woman obviously causes negative feelings and sense of injustice. And there we have discovered the double standard.
